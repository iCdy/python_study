High digitization rates and the resulting large volumes of data that must be sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return signal have limited array sizes and effectively precluded real-time operation.There is, therefore, a need in the art for improved capture and handling of data employed for coherent laser detection and ranging.SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSUREA frequency modulated (coherent) laser detection and ranging system includes a read-out integrated circuit formed with a two-dimensional array of detector elements each including a photosensitive region receiving both return light reflected from a target and light from a local oscillator, and local processing circuitry sampling the output of the photosensitive region four times during each sample period clock cycle to obtain quadrature components. A data bus coupled to one or more outputs of each of the detector elements receives the quadrature components from each of the detector elements for each sample period and serializes the received quadrature components. A processor coupled to the data bus receives the serialized quadrature components and determines an amplitude and a phase for at least one interfering frequency corresponding to interference between the return light and the local oscillator light using the quadrature components.Although specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include some, none, or all of the enumerated advantages. Additionally, other technical advantages may become readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art after review of the following figures and description.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFor a more complete understanding of the present disclosure and its advantages, reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals represent like parts:FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C diagrammatically illustrate operation of, respectively, a pulsed LADAR system typically employed for long-range 3D imaging, an AM LADAR system typically used for shorter range applications, and an FM LADAR system based on frequency modulation of a coherent laser source;FIGS. 2 and 2A illustrate data processing associated with use of an FM LADAR system using GmAPD receivers in the detector array;FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure; andFIG. 4 illustrates use of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR for real-time interferometry in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONIt should be understood at the outset that, although exemplary embodiments are illustrated in the figures and described below, the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or not. The present disclosure should in no way be limited to the exemplary implementations and techniques illustrated in the drawings and described below. Additionally, unless otherwise specifically noted, articles depicted in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.Laser detection and ranging (LADAR) systems are the optical analog of radar systems, in which the target is illuminated with light from a laser source and the return is detected with an optical detector. The resulting signal from the optical detector is processed to determine information about the target, such as range or velocity.LADAR applications are driven to some extent by component technologies. Laser sources include both diode lasers that are generally compact, efficient, and low-cost but only low power, and eye-safe lasers that operate at wavelengths greater than about 1.5 microns (μm) and enable long-range, free-space LADAR. Detectors are often array detectors, to reduce the requirement for beam scanning. Processors, because processing of LADAR data can be computationally intensive, must typically enable high-speed—and often real-time—LADAR imaging.Two-dimensional arrays of coherent detectors are required for many advanced coherent laser detection and ranging (LADAR) systems. A conventional approach is to use an array of discrete high-bandwidth detectors each having an amplifier, analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and memory. The resulting large volume of data is then sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return signal. The high digitization rates and large volumes of resulting data have limited array sizes to a small number of pixels (on the order of 10s of pixels). There is also typically a large time interval required to process the data so that real-time operation is not achieved.LADAR systems may generally be grouped into three main categories: pulsed LADAR, in which the illuminating laser is pulsed and the detector records time-of-flight; amplitude modulated (AM) LADAR, in which the amplitude of the illuminating beam is sinusoidally modulated and the detector records phase of return amplitude modulation; and frequency modulated (FM) LADAR, in which the frequency and/or phase of the laser illumination is modulated, and the detector records the relative optical phase of the return signal. (Additionally, some LADAR systems use the parallax effect, which is not considered in this disclosure.) All three categories of LADAR systems are used in various application-dependent environments, typically with use of pulsed LADAR for long range mapping, AM modulated LADAR for short range three dimensional (3D) imaging, and FM modulated LADAR for interferometry, frequency domain optical coherence tomography, and synthetic aperture imaging.FIG. 1A diagrammatically illustrates operation of a pulsed LADAR system 100 typically employed for long-range 3D imaging. A laser source 101 emits pulsed light 102 illuminating a distant target 103. The laser 101 is ideally an eye-safe, high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) emitting pulses on the order of 1 nanosecond (ns) duration, and high pulse energy device enabling long range, large field-of-view operation by the system 100. A return part 104 of the light 102 reflecting off the target 103 and reaching an imaging telescope 105 is focused by the imaging telescope 105 onto a two dimensional (2D) detector array 106 comprising M×N pixels. The detector array 106 records return time (time-of-flight) on a per-pixel basis, with the output of the detector array 106 processed by a processor (not shown separately in FIG. 1A) capable of handling high data and throughput rates to determine relative timing of return signals at different pixels and produce a 3D image. Implementing a detector array with sufficient timing resolution is a challenging design issue for this type of system. The detector array 106 should preferably comprise detector pixels that incorporate high-speed detection and local processing, to achieve fine timing-resolution detection and reduce the volume of data sent from the detector array to the processor. Some imaging detector arrays convert optical intensity into a serialized (raster scanned) analog signal, with an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter with memory (e.g., a frame-grabber) used to capture the data before transferring the data to a processor. 2D detectors generally incorporate digital processing into each pixel and the associated detector readout circuit, which is enabled by modern, fine-detail integrated circuit fabrication processes and which forms a digital readout integrated circuit (ROIC). Applications of digital ROIC technology are especially useful for improving data quality or reducing the volume of data. Advanced infrared (IR) detectors use digital ROICs with A/D conversion incorporated into the pixels to enhance dynamic range. LADAR systems use digital ROICs for fine resolution timing of return signals, to determine the temporal location of peak return rather than digitizing the entire temporal signal.Another aspect of pulsed LADAR systems is that for long-range operation, high-sensitivity detector elements such as avalanche photo diodes (APDs) are required. In this regime, the photonic nature of the light must be considered, such that APDs are adjusted to operate in high-gain, Geiger-mode (GmAPDs). The analog signal from a GmAPD is series of temporal pulses caused by one or more of: photo-events from the return signal (shot-noise); spontaneous photo-events from dark noise (dark counts); photo-events from background light (background counts); and photo-events triggered by other events (ghosts). There can also be intra-pixel cross talk within an array of GmAPDs. Nonetheless, an array of GmAPDs with a digital ROIC is naturally well-suited for pulsed LADAR, since a GmAPD array records only time-stamps corresponding to sparse photo-events rather than digitizing temporal intensity signal and high PRF lasers allow averaging over multiple pulses to reduce impact of noise. In the photon-limited regime, the photo-sensitive detector is typically a GmAPD array with an ROIC that records arrival times for photo-events.FIG. 1B diagrammatically illustrates operation of an AM LADAR system 110 typically used for shorter range applications. The laser source 111 in this implementation provides AM modulated light 112. The relative phase of the return signal 114 focused by imaging telescope 115 on detector array 116 provides a relative 3D range over the target 113. A typical modulation frequency for the light 112 is on the order of 10s of mega-Hertz (MHz)(e.g., 30 MHz, which results in an ambiguity interval of 5 meters). AM LADAR systems are often configured as a scanning system, but more recent implementations use a detector array. For detector arrays, every pixel should be capable of independently determining the distance to the object based on light received at that pixel, in effect operating as a massively parallel laser illuminated detection and ranging (LIDAR) on a single integrated circuit. Each pixel should allow accurate measurement of the arrival time of the collected photons in order to be substantially immune to detector array surface defects that might otherwise adversely affect time of flight ranging. Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based GmAPD pixels in the detector array enable such accurate measurement. SPAD devices detect the incoming sinusoidally modulated light intensity as series of photo-events using a high speed clock cycled through four states (quadrature detection). Photo-events that occur during these separate clock states are accumulated for use in a detection process that utilizes a synchronous clock to determine a phase of the return signal based on the accumulated photo-events corresponding to the four clock states. The gaming and machine vision industries in particular have driven development of sophisticated AM LADAR detectors with photon-counting based synchronous detection, measurement of modulation quadrature values performed at the pixel level, and fabrication based on low cost complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes.FIG. 1C diagrammatically illustrates operation of an FM LADAR system 120 based on frequency modulation of a coherent laser source. The laser source in this implementation includes a master oscillator (MO) 121a, a frequency modulator (FM) 121b, and an amplifier (AMP) 121c producing the output 122 illuminating the target 123, and a second frequency modulator 121d receiving a signal from the master oscillator 121a together with a local oscillator (LO) 121e producing an output 127 illuminating the detector array 126. The target 123 is illuminated with coherent light 122 that originates from the master oscillator 121a and passes through the frequency modulator 121b and amplifier 121c. The return light 124 focused on the detector array 126 by the imaging telescope 125 interferes with light 127 from the local oscillator 121e, a frequency modulated beam derived from the master oscillator 121a. The amplitude and phase of the return signal 124 provide information about the target 123. The detector pixels detect a sinusoidally modulated interference signal—that is, the signal incident on the pixels results from coherent interference of the return beam 124 and the local oscillator beam 127. For the simple case of a frequency offset between the return and local oscillator beams, the resulting signal intensity detected by the pixels is:I\\u2061(t)=Is+ILO+2\\u2062Is\\u2062ILO\\u2062cos\\u2061(2\\u2062π\\u2062\\u2062ft+ϕ),\\nwhere I(t) is the intensity of the signal received by a pixel within the detector array, Is is the intensity of the return light 124, ILO is the intensity of the local oscillator light 127, f is the interfering frequency, and ϕ is a phase shift between the return light 124 and the local oscillator light 127 at the interfering frequency f. A feature of FM detection is that the strength of the modulated signal is proportional to √{square root over (Is)}√{square root over (ILO)}, such that the signal is boosted by the local oscillator power. In addition to being useful for long range detection, FM systems are also employed in interferometry.\\nFIGS. 2 and 2A illustrate data processing 200 associated with use of an FM LADAR system using GmAPD receivers in the detector array. An intensity signal 201, derived from interfering return and local oscillator light signals 202, corresponds to photo-events 203. Processing of the photo-event sequence 204 yields target information, including values 205 such as those illustrated in the figure. To avoid saturation of the GmAPD detector, the local oscillator level is reduced. The signal intensity detected is:I\\u2061(t)=Ns+NLO+NDCR+2\\u2062ηHET\\u2062Is\\u2062ILO\\u2062cos\\u2061(2\\u2062π\\u2062\\u2062ft+ϕ),\\nwhere Ns is the number of signal photo-events, NLO is the number of local oscillator photo-events, NDCR is the number of dark counts, and ηHET is heterodyne detection efficiency. A typical approach to implementing FM LADAR with GmAPD detector arrays has been to record a temporal sequence of photo-events and depicted in FIG. 2, then process the recorded events to compute a Fourier transform resulting in a frequency spectrum mapping of the events as illustrated in FIG. 2A to determine f and ϕ.\\nFIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The optical detector 300 is employed as the detector array 126 in the system depicted in FIG. 1C. The optical detector 300 is formed by a two-dimensional M×N array of pixels. The optical detector 300 is a large format array having more than on the order of ten pixels in each direction and preferably having on the order of hundreds of pixels or more in each direction (e.g., a 512×512 or larger array). Each pixel within the optical detector 300 has a photosensitive material 301 receiving the sinusoidal return comprising return light and coherently interfering local oscillator light as described above in connection with FIGS. 1C and 2. The photosensitive material 301 for each pixel produces an analog output 303 received by a local processing circuit 304 for the respective pixel. Each local processing circuit 304 receives a local clock signal 305 and outputs four quadrature value signals 306 representing sampling of the analog output 303 at intervals during a single sample period. The local clock signal 305 is received from, and the quadrature signals 306 are provided to, a data bus 307 that operates under the control of one or more timing/control signals 308 and that outputs serialized digital representations of the quadrature signals 306 on a signal line 309 to a processor or computer 310. Processor/computer 310 (or at least portions thereof) may be formed on the same integrated circuit chip and/or packaged within the same integrated circuit package as the remainder of optical detector 300. Within the processor/computer 310, each of the quadrature signals is separately processed in the manner described above in connection with FIGS. 2 and 2A. The detector 300 thus applies ROIC technology to coherent detection, computing quadrature components Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 of a single interfering frequency (IF) component or optionally a small number of IF components. The quadrature components—and therefore the amplitude and phase—of the IF are computed at the sensor frame rate, allowing detection to be performed on a large format 2D detector.It should be noted that, although quadrature components are described in the exemplary embodiment above, the number of samples captured during a clock sample period may be less (e.g., three) or more (e.g., five or greater) than four. The number of parallel signal lines 306 from the local processing circuit 304 for each pixel and the data bus 307 would naturally match the number of samples captured at intervals during a single sample period.Applications of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR include real-time interferometry, velocity measurement, vibration sensing, two-wavelength 3D imaging, and wavefront sensing for atmospheric compensation. Synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR enables 3D imaging at much longer ranges than AM systems, and is applicable to the gaming industry and virtual reality systems.FIG. 4 illustrates use of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR for real-time interferometry in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. For real-time interferometry, the phase data from coherent synchronous detection is equivalent to an interferogram, and quadrature detection is equivalent to phase-shifting interferometry. In the real-time interferometry system 400, an FM laser source 401 emits illumination 402 that is split by a beam splitter 403 such that a portion is received by a frequency modulator 404, which produces frequency modulated illumination 405 based on the emitted light 402. A remainder of the emitted light 402 passes through a lens 406 onto a half-silvered mirror 407 that reflects part of the light onto a test surface 408. Portions of the light reflecting off test surface 408 passes through mirror 407 and through lens 409 to impinge upon an optical detector 410 structured as depicted in FIG. 3. The reference light 405 passes through a lens 411 and reflects off half-silvered mirror 407, and then also passes through lens 409 to impinge upon the optical detector 410. In this implementation, the light reflected off test surface 408 and passing through mirror 407 to reach the optical detector 410 corresponds to the return light 124 reflected off the target 123 in FIG. 1C, while the reference light 405 reflected off the mirror 407 to reach the optical detector 410 corresponds to the local oscillator light 127. In this application, the high frame-rate capability of the optical detector 410 allows analysis of components in dynamic conditions. The phase difference between interferograms at different times allows determination of displacement, and therefore velocity measurement (since displacement per unit time is velocity), and measurement of velocity periodicity allows determination of vibration. The difference between phase measurements at two wavelengths (which may be recorded sequentially or, for an advanced synchronous detector, on two interference frequencies) provides 3D imaging.For turbulence compensation, coherent synchronous detection also allows real-time recording of complex-values images, to which a sharpness algorithm may be used to determine atmospheric phase error to produce a turbulence-corrected image or to determine the correction to be applied to pre-compensate a high-energy laser. Additional details of turbulence correction may be found in J. C. Marron, et al., “Atmospheric turbulence correction using digital holographic detection: experimental results,” Optics Express, 17, 11638-11651 (2009).For digital holography, conventional detector arrays employ long pulse illumination with zero interference frequency. The static fringe pattern recorded represents coherent information recorded on a spatial carrier frequency. Synchronous coherent detection can operate at Q=1 rather than Q=2.Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

Nos. 286,613, filed Sept. 5, 1972, now abandoned, and 360,464, filed May 15, 1973, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,941.In my aforesaid co-pending applications there are described processes and apparatus for recycling used asphalt-aggregate compositions. That apparatus, of which the present invention constitutes an improvement, includes an elongated cylindrical drum having a plurality of heating tubes extending substantially along the length of the drum interior. Used asphalt-aggregate compositions are recycled by introducing them into an input end of the drum and rotating the drum while heating the tubes so that the composition becomes heated gradually by contact with the heated tube surfaces. The description in my aforesaid applications of the apparatus and method of its use in producing recycled asphalt-aggregate compositions are incorporated herein by reference.Previous methods of heating asphalt compositions utilizing tumbling action within a cylinder, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,423,222, are inefficient since the materials are directly exposed to flame emitted from a burner. Not only does such exposure to direct flame or hot gases cause burning and deterioration of asphalt, since the only portion of the material being heated is that exposed on the surface of the mass, but the resulting smoke and vapors drawn into the atmosphere are obviously a pollution hazard. In my previous co-pending applications this disadvantage is eliminated by utilizing heating pipes which not only avoids contamination in burning of the asphalt, since there is no exposure to flame, but also greatly increases the heating efficiency since a significant amount of material is in contact with the hot tubes. Moreover, complete mixing of the composition is greatly facilitated, because the pipes act to deflect the material in different directions cascading over the hot tubes as the drum rotates, thereby, improving the compositions\\' homogeneity.In my later filed application Ser. No. 360,464, there is disclosed means for venting moisture or water vapor given off during the heating process from the input end of the cylindrical drum where temperatures are coolest. In addition, there is also disclosed means for venting hydrocarbon gases volatilized from the heated asphalt composition at the hot output end and directing the gas into the heating or combustion chamber.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned improvements in both the apparatus and process techniques, there have remained certain problems which are to be solved according to the present invention. It has been found that, even with the addition of required amounts of make-up asphalt to the recycled material, in many cases, the asphalt present in the used recycled material has lost so much of the light hydrocarbons originally present that penetration and viscosity characteristics of the composition have been greatly affected. Thus, further improvement of the recycled asphalt-aggregate compositions is achieved by adding petroleum hydrocarbons during the heating and mixing process whereby the original viscosity and penetration characteristics are obtained without weakening the material.Still another problem is in the venting of hydrocarbon gases from the output end of the apparatus where the recycled composition is heated to its highest temperatures in the process. This is especially so where the used material being recycled contains significant amounts of water, even though some water vapor is vented at the relatively cool input end of the apparatus since much of the moisture remains in the material and is carried forward in the process, being vaporized nearer the output end thus using significant amounts of heat in the water vaporization. It is also desirable to remove this water vapor from the hydrocarbon gases vented from the heating cavity and directed to the combustion chamber.In both of my aforesaid co-pending applications the elongated cylindrical drum, in which the asphalt-aggregate composition is mixed and heated incorporates a heating chamber at the forward or output end of the apparatus. A front end wall of the cylindrical drum forms one wall of heating chamber into which a flame from a gas or other fuel burner is directed. In addition, the heating tubes have open ends extending from this front wall and communicating with the heating chamber so that the tubes and front wall itself become extremely hot. This causes loss of hydrocarbon volatiles and even excessive burning or coking of the asphalt at the output end of the cylindrical drum from contact with extremely hot front wall and tube surfaces adjacent the front wall. It is to the elimination of these disadvantages and problems that the present invention is directed.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn the present invention the product achieved is significantly improved in penetration characteristics by adding petroleum hydrocarbon, preferably having a major amount, and even more preferable, at least about 55% by weight aromatic hydrocarbons. This petroleum hydrocarbon material is preferably added near the output end of the drum or after the used asphalt-aggregate composition has been heated in a heating and mixing chamber to a temperature of at least about 200° F. followed by further mixing of the product to achieve substantial homogeneity.The problem of water vapor present in the volatilized hydrocarbon gaseous mixture is obviated by venting the gaseous composition into an elongated conduit in which the water vapor is condensed, drawn off or drained and the hydrocarbon gases are then directed to the heating chamber of the apparatus.In still another improvement, coking or burning of asphalt at the hot output end of the apparatus is obviated by providing a front plate spaced apart from the forward end wall of the cylindrical drum and which front plate is exposed to the heating chamber. A plurality of relatively short, open-ended pipes of cross-section dimension smaller than the heating tubes are secured to the front plate and communicate with the heating chamber at their forward ends and extend for a distance into the larger heating tubes. In this manner neither the forward wall of the drum nor the heating tubes are exposed directly to the heating chamber thereby significantly reducing burning and deterioration of the asphalt without lowering the efficiency of the apparatus. These improvements will be more specifically described in the following detailed description.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe FIGURE is a side view, partially in section, showing the output end of a cylindrical drum modified according to the invention.RECYCLED ASPHALT-AGGREGATE COMPOSITIONIt has been found in many cases that used asphalt-aggregate compositions have become rather brittle or hard. Because of the deterioration of the asphalt in the old composition, where hydrocarbons have been volatilized or otherwise lost through exposure, use and heat, often the recycled composition does not have the penetration characteristics of freshly prepared or virgin asphalt-aggregate compositions.According to the invention it has been found that by adding a petroleum hydrocarbon to the used composition being recycled, desired penetration and viscosity characteristics are achieved which are substantially the same as virgin asphalt-aggregate compositions. Although diesel oil or gas oil or other similar relatively light petroleum hydrocarbons may be used and which have boiling ranges of, for example, between about 450°-800° F., somewhat less volatile hydrocarbons are preferred. It will be understood where the hydrocarbon is too light or volatile, it may cause too much thinning of the composition which weakens the binder and strength characteristics of the final material. Preferred hydrocarbons are the highly aromatic, low viscosity, low volatility petroleum fractions such as thermally cracked residues, high boiling fractions of catalytically cracked gas oil, boiling fractions of cracking cycle stocks, residues from pyrolysis of residual petroleum fuel oils used in the production of gas and the like, and highly aromatic extracts of distillate oils used in making lube oils. Preferred members of the latter group include the high boiling extracts obtained by use of nonreactive highly polar, aromatically preferential solvents such as liquid sulfur dioxide, phenol, cresylic acid, beta-dichloroethyl ether, nitrobenzene, etc. The use of the so-called double solvent process employing mutually immiscible solvents like cresylic acid and propane also yields suitable extracts. The useful hydrocarbon fractions may contain paraffinic unsaturated and naphthenic compounds, but are predominantly aromatic, that is, they contain above about 55 percent and preferably above 65 percent aromatics by weight. Viscosities of these materials may range from about 35-150 SSU at 210° F to 75  to more than 13,000 SSU at 100° F. In general, the most preferred petroleum hydrocarbon fractions have a viscosity-gravity constant (VGC) above 0.905 and initial boiling points above about 300° F. and, preferably, above 500° F. Mixtures of these hydrocarbons may also be used. More preferable, initial boiling points of the hydrocarbon compositions are above about 500° F with flash points (c.o.c.) above about 300° F. Typical of these hydrocarbons are \"Dutrex\" oils available from Shell Chemical Co.Addition of the petroleum hydrocarbons to the used asphalt-aggregate materials may be accomplished at any time during the process; for example, just prior to or at the time these used materials are placed in the cylindrical drum. However, the petroleum hydrocarbon is preferably added within the cylindrical drum mixing chamber when the asphalt-aggregate and make-up asphalt composition mixture has been heated to above about 200° F and is, or approaches a semi-fluid composition. Accordingly, this addition takes place in the forward half of the mixing cavities, i.e., the portion of the cavity toward the hotter output end of the cylindrical mixing drum. This may be readily accomplished by extending a pipe 44 through chute cover 34 as shown in the FIGURE having an open end 42 which may be a spray nozzle or the like within mixing cavity 40. The pipe 44 is connected to a tank or other source containing the petroleum hydrocarbon, and preferably with means provided for metering the proper amounts of hydrocarbon into the mixing cavity at desired times or continuously during the processing. The specific amounts of hydrocarbon to be added, according to the invention, will vary depending on the hardness of the used asphalt-aggregate composition being recycled, and the desired penetration of the final material. The desired penetration of laid down asphalt is usually between the 35 and about 300 dmm (ASTM method D-5), the higher penetration within this range being used in colder weather surfacing and lower penetrations within the range during warm weather. It will also be appreciated that penetration of asphalt will usually decrease after mixing and lay down. For example, the penetration of 85/100 asphalt after mixing and lay-down is about 50-60 dmm at 77° F, 60/70 asphalt is about 35-45 dmm, and that of 40/50 asphalt about 25/35 dmm. Variations depend on the type of asphalt and mixing cycles used.The following example illustrates the improvements of compositions by adding the hydrocarbons.Samples of used asphalt were mixed with a petroleum hydrocarbon having the following properties:______________________________________Viscosity, SSU/100° F.               13,430SSU/210° F.  99.3Gravity, °API               5.6Specific Gravity/60° F.               1.0320Flash Point, c.o.c., °F.               425Distillation, °F.IBP                 7405%                  76510%                 77250%                 81890%                 884Viscosity-Gravity Constant (VGC)               0.996Molecular Analysis, Clay-Gel %WAsphaltenes         0Polar Compounds     18.0Aromatics           76.0Saturates           6.0______________________________________The hydrocarbon was added to the samples and the mixtures were heated and mixed until thoroughly blended.

However, it will be appreciated that different amounts of hydrocarbon may be required for different types of used compositions depending on age and characteristics of the asphalt present in the recycled mixture to achieve the desired penetration and viscosity characteristics. Accordingly, the examples given here are representative only for the purpose of illustration. It will also be understood that blends of various petroleum hydrocarbons, and especially blends of materials having the characteristics set forth herein, may be used in different amounts than those indicated to achieve the desired penetrations and viscosities.INTERNAL HEATING PIPESReferring further to the FIGURE, there is illustrated the forward or output end of cylindrical drum 12 which has an improved design for reducing coking or burning and undue loss of hydrocarbons of recycled asphalt-aggregate composition 25 within the mixing cavity 40. Pursuant to the invention, a front plate 16 is exposed to firing chamber 48 and is spaced apart forwardly from end wall 50 of the drum 12. Accordingly, an airspace 32 extends along the forward end of the cylinder, between front wall 50 and front plate 16, which provides insulation to further reduce heating of the front wall, which contacts the asphalt containing composition. Within each of the heating tubes 31 are inserted relatively short pipes 20 open at both ends. The forward end of the pipes 20 are provided with a flange 18 or other similar means for being secured to front plate 16 which then acts as a support for maintaining the pipes in spacial relationship from the interior sides of the heating tubes 31. These pipes may also be provided with orifices 26 near or adjacent to the interior pipe end 24 for further distribution of the heat from heating chamber 48, which is directed into the forward, open end of the pipes exposed to the chamber. The number of such orifices or ports, or their use, is optional.The length to which the pipes extend into the heating tubes depends on the location which the hot gases are desired to be directed. As a practical matter, a distance of between about 1 and about 3 feet, or more preferable about 2 feet, rearwardly from front plate 16 is desirable. It will be understood that the pipes should not extend too far from the front plate into the heating tubes since the recycled composition is to be gradually heated from the input end reaching its hottest temperatures at the output end.The distance between the forward end wall and the front plate is not critical, and a matter of a few inches, for example, about 2 to about 6 inches, will be desirable, it being understood that the purpose is to prevent forward wall 50 of the cylindrical mixing drum 12 from becoming unduly hot, which would cause coking and burning of the composition contacting the wall. Moreover, the heating tubes are not directly exposed to the firing chamber since the heat must first be directed through the pipes which are separated or spaced from the interior heating tube walls. This further reduces the temperature of the heating tubes near front plate 50 and eliminates coking or burning, and volatile hydrocarbon losses from the heated composition. Front plate 16 as well as the pipes should be constructed of materials which will be resistant to the temperatures to which they are exposed in the heating chamber. Stainless steel or similar material is quite useful.VENTING OF GASESThe FIGURE further shows modification of the apparatus for venting a gaseous mixture of combustible hydrocarbon volatiles and water vapor given off by the heated asphalt-aggregate composition at the output end. As previously explained, although moisture may be removed at the cooler output end of the apparatus, some moisture remains in the gradually heated composition and becomes vaporized as the composition temperature increases toward the output end. It will be understood that moisture in the gradually heated composition will take up greater amounts of heat energy required for vaporization and lower the efficiency of the process in heating the compositions to above about 225° F. Accordingly, a conduit with open end 38 within the drum mixing cavity 40, adjacent to the output end or in chute chamber 30, as shown, is provided. The opposite open end 14 of the conduit communicates with heating chamber 48 for return of the volatile hydrocarbon gases given off by the heated asphalt. The volatilized gases and water vapor from the hot asphalt containing composition are directed into end 38 of conduit 36. These gaseous mixtures are pulled into the conduit and therethrough by a draft or vacuum created in heating chamber 48 as flame from a burner directs heat through the heating tubes. As the gaseous mixture of hydrocarbon volatiles and water vapor drawn into conduit 36 are gradually cooled, the water vapor will be condensed and collect along the interior conduit surface. A drain tube 46, which communicates with conduit 36 provides a means for removing the condensed moisture from the interior passageway, and which moisture is then simply drained through the tube and discarded. The length of conduit 36 is critical only so that it will allow a sufficient cooling of the gaseous mixture containing both the hydrocarbon volatiles, which are to be directed to the heating chamber, and the vaporized moisture, and to allow the latter to condense so that it is separated within the interior passageway. A gate, one-way flutter valve or equivalent means along tube 46, which will allow the condensed vapor to pass from the drain tube without drawing air therethrough, so as not to significantly reduce the draft within the conduit, will also be of use. Moreover, the location of conduit end 38 within chute chamber 30, which is merely an extension of mixing cavity 40, or within the mixing cavity itself, is critical only in that it be positioned for adequate venting of the gaseous mixture to achieve its desired function. Various modifications of the design of the apparatus to achieve the intended purpose, within the purview of the invention, will be understood by those skilled in the art as will other equivalent modifications of the apparatus described herein.', 'pn_kind': 'A', 'agents': [{'sequence': '1', 'format': 'original', 'name': 'Seiler and Quirk', 'load-source': 'patent-office'}], 'apn_num': '05488518', 'apn_original': 'US05488518', 'title_en': 'Process for recycling asphalt-aggregate compositions', 'citation_num': '12'}\n",

No. 239,099, filed Aug. 31, 1988, now abandoned.DESCRIPTIONBackground of the InventionDuring glycolysis, cells convert simple sugars, such as glucose, into pyruvic acid, with a net production of ATP and NADH. In the absence of a functioning electron transport system for oxidative phosphorylation, at least 95% of the pyruvic acid is consumed in short pathways which regenerate NAD+, an obligate requirement for continued glycolysis and ATP production. The waste products of these NAD+ regeneration systems are commonly referred to as fermentation products.Microorganisms are particularly diverse in the array of fermentation products which are produced by different genera (Krieg, N. R., and J. G. Holt, eds. [1984] Bergey\\'s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore). These products include organic acids, such as lactate, acetate, succinate, and butyrate, as well as neutral products, such as ethanol, butanol, acetone, and butanediol. Indeed, the diversity of fermentation products from bacteria has led to their use as a primary determinant in taxonomy (Krieg and Holt [1984], supra).End products of fermentation share several fundamental features. They are relatively nontoxic under the conditions in which they are initially produced but become more toxic upon accumulation. They are more reduced than pyruvate because their immediate precursors have served as terminal electron acceptors during glycolysis. The microbial production of these fermentation products forms the basis for our oldest and most economically successful applications of biotechnology and includes dairy products, meats, beverages, and fuels. In recent years, many advances have been made in the field of biotechnology as a result of new technologies which enable researchers to selectively alter the genetic makeup of some microorganisms.Escherichia coli is an important vehicle for the cloning and modification of genes for biotechnology and is one of the most important hosts for the production of recombinant products. In recent years, the range of hosts used for recombinant DNA research has been extended to include a variety of bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and some eukaryotic cells. The invention described here relates to the use of recombinant DNA technology to elicit the production of specific useful products by a modified host.The DNA used to modify the host of the subject invention is isolated from Zymomonas mobilis. Z. mobilis is a microorganism with unusual metabolic characteristics which is commonly found in plant saps and in honey. Z. mobilis has long served as a natural inocula for the fermentation of the Agave sap to produce pulque (an alcohol-containing Mexican beverage) and as inocula for palm wines. This organism is also used for fuel ethanol production and has been reported capable of ethanol production rates which are substantially higher than that of yeasts.Although Z. mobilis is nutritionally simple and capable of synthesizing amino acids, nucleotides and vitamins, the range of sugars metabolized by this organism is very limited and normally consists of glucose, fructose and sucrose. Substrate level phosphorylation from the fermentation of these sugars is the sole source of energy for biosynthesis and homeostasis. Z. mobilis is incapable of growth even in rich medium such as nutrient broth without a fermentable sugar.Z. mobilis is an obligately fermentative bacterium which lacks a functional system for oxidative phosphorylation. This organism, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produces ethanol and carbon dioxide as principal fermentation products. Z. mobilis produces ethanol by a short pathway which requires only two enzymatic activities: pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. Pyruvate decarboxylase is the key enzyme in this pathway which diverts the flow of pyruvate to ethanol. Pyruvate decarboxylase catalyzes the nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to produce acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. Two alcohol dehydrogenase isozymes are present in this organism and catalyze the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol during fermentation, accompanied by the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. Although bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases are common in many organisms, few bacteria have pyruvate decarboxylase. Attempts to modify Z. mobilis to enhance its commercial utility as an ethanol producer have met with very limited success.Most fuel ethanol is currently produced from hexose sugars in corn starch or cane syrup utilizing either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Zymomonas mobilis. However, these are relatively expensive sources of biomass sugars and have competing value as foods. Starches and sugars represent only a fraction of the total carbohydrates in plants. The dominant forms of plant carbohydrate in stems, leaves, hulls, husks, cobs, etc. are the structural wall polymers, cellulose and hemicellulose. Hydrolysis of these polymers releases a mixture of neutral sugars which include glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and arabinose. No single organism has been found in nature which can rapidly and efficiently metabolize these sugars into ethanol or any other single product of value.The genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase II and pyruvate decarboxylase in Z. mobilis have been separately cloned, characterized, and expressed in E. coli (Brau, B., and H. Sahm [1986] Arch. Microbiol. 146:105-110; Brau, B. and H. Sahm [1986] Arch. Microbiol. 144:296-301; Conway, T., Y. A. Osman, J. I. Konnan, E. M. Hoffmann, and L. O. Ingram [1987] J. Bacteriol. 169:949-954; Conway, T., G. W. Sewell, Y. A. Osman, and L. O. Ingram [1987] J. Bacteriol. 169:2591-2597; Neale, A. D., R. K. Scopes, R. E. H. Wettenhall, and N. J. Hoogenraad [1987] Nucleic Acid. Res. 15:1753-1761; Ingram, L. O., and T. Conway [1988] Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54:397-404; Ingram, L. O., T. Conway, D. P. Clark, G. W. Sewell, and J. F. Preston [1987] Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53:2420-2425).Brau and Sahm (Brau, B. and H. Sahm [1986] Arch. Microbiol. 144:296-301) first demonstrated that ethanol production could be increased in recombinant E. coli by the over-expression of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase although very low ethanol concentrations were produced. Subsequent studies by Tolan and Finn extended this work by using two other enteric bacteria (Erwinia chrysanthemi, Tolan, J. S. and R. K. Finn [1987] Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53:2033-2038; Klebsiella planticola, Tolan, J. S. and R. K. Finn [1987] Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53:2039-2044) and achieved higher levels of ethanol from hexoses, pentoses, and sugar mixtures. The subject invention relates to the creation and expression of a novel operon coding for an efficient ethanol-producing system. This novel operon can be used to transform microorganisms in order to confer upon the transformed microbes the capability of producing ethanol in useful quantities. The inventors know of no prior art which discloses the successful combination of genes from different organisms, under different control systems, into an operon under a common control system.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention described here concerns the construction of a unique portable operon for ethanol production which includes both the alcohol dehydrogenase II and pyruvate decarboxylase activities of the ethanologenic pathway. This unique operon, designated the pet operon, contains the two genes needed for ethanol production. This system is capable of effectively diverting pyruvate to ethanol during growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.Also described here are novel strains of E. coli which contain ethanol-producing operons. These recombinant strains demonstrate the surprising and advantageous characteristic of forming larger colonies on plates containing sugars. Also, these recombinant strains grow to seven-fold higher cell densities in batch culture. Thus, the invention described here can be used to increase the growth and yield of recombinant microorganisms producing any product.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 shows the construction of pLOI295 containing genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II from Zymomonas mobilis.FIG. 2 shows several plasmids containing the genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II from Zymomonas mobilis.

This is one of the reasons why E. coli is an attractive host for recombinant DNA procedures. The invention described here allows the use of recombinant strains of simple organisms for the production of ethanol from under-utilized sources of biomass, such as hemicellulose (xylose, arabinose, etc.), which represents a major portion of wood and inedible plant parts, and whey (lactose), as well as from other biomass sources. Also, organisms with special capabilities, such as extracellular enzymes for the degradation of complex polymers, can be converted to ethanol producers by using the subject invention.The novel invention described here can be used in connection with many different hosts. For example, in addition to E. coli, enteric bacteria such as Erwinia chrysanthemi and Klebsiella planticola are particularly attractive hosts because they are capable of utilizing a wide variety of sugars including pentoses and lactose. Additional potential hosts include other bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and eukaryotic cells. Appropriate expression systems would be used for the particular host involved. Ascertaining the proper expression system is within the skill of scientists trained in this field.Described here is a novel operon which directs cells to produce ethanol. This operon has been designated as the pet operon. The pet operon comprises Z. mobilis genes coding for the alcohol dehydrogenase II and pyruvate decarboxylase activities together with appropriate regulatory sequences. The regulatory sequences may consist of promoters, inducers, operators, ribosomal binding sites, terminators, and/or other regulatory sequences. Ethanol production in previous recombinant systems was dependent upon native activities in the host organisms. Advantageously, the dependence upon host alcohol dehydrogenase activity has been eliminated by combining Z. mobilis genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase II and pyruvate decarboxylase to form the PET operon.Using the materials and methods described herein, significant amounts of ethanol can be produced in recombinants containing the pet operon under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.From the foregoing discussion it should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that the concept disclosed here, i.e., combining genes coding for a metabolic pathway into a single operon, is an extremely novel and useful approach. The application of this concept to a variety of situations where genes from different genetic loci are combined to create a useful operon is envisioned as part of this invention. The creation of the pet operon is only one example of this novel inventive concept. Thus, using the principles described here, genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase activity from a variety of organisms could be combined with other genes coding for the pyruvate decarboxylase activity in order to create an operon coding for the desired pathway. Operons coding for other pathways could also be created. It should also be apparent to one skilled in the art that, for the ethanolic pathway described here, it is not necessary that the genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activities be under common control; they could be under separate control and even in different plasmids, or placed on the chromosome.Under aerobic conditions in E. coli, pyruvate from glycolysis is primarily metabolized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and by lactate dehydrogenase (Gottschalk, G. [1986] Bacterial Metabolism, pp. 210-280. Springer-Verlag, New York), with excess acetyl coenzyme A being converted to acetate. The apparent Km s for these two enzymes are 0.4 and 7.2 mM, respectively. The apparent Km for Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase is equal to (pyruvate dehydrogenase) or lower than (lactate dehydrogenase) those for the two E. coli enzymes, thereby facilitating acetaldehyde production. NADH+ regeneration under aerobic conditions results primarily from biosynthesis and from the NADH oxidase (coupled to the electron transport system) with an apparent Km of 50 uM. The apparent Km for Z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II is over fourfold lower than that for E. coli NAD+ oxidase, allowing the Z. mobilis enzyme to compete effectively for endogenous pools of NADH for the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol. Thus, the properties of the Z. mobilis ethanologenic enzymes and their relatively high levels of expression are well suited for the diversion of carbon flow into ethanol under aerobic conditions.Under anaerobic conditions in E. coli, pyruvate from glycolysis is primarily metabolized by lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase. The apparent Km s for these two enzymes are 18-fold and 5-fold higher, respectively, than that for Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase. Similarly, the apparent Km s for the principal enzymes involved in NAD+ regeneration in E. coli are also considerably higher than those for Z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II. Thus, the ethanologenic enzymes from Z. mobilis are quite competitive for carbon (pyruvate) and reducing potential (NADH) with the normal fermentative enzymes of E. coli, allowing the efficient channeling of glycolytic products into ethanol.The genes encoding the two ethanologenic enzymes, denoted the pet operon, were expressed at high levels and dominated carbon flow from pyruvate and NADH oxidation during anaerobic growth. Under these conditions, the flow of pyruvate carbon skeletons was diverted from the production of organic acids to the production of ethanol as the principal fermentation product in E. coli.The accumulation of organic acids from sugar metabolism is generally regarded as a consequence of fermentation during anaerobic growth. However, appreciable quantities of acetate are produced by the parent strain of E. coli TC4 even during rapid agitation under aerobic conditions. The production of acetate by strain TC4 is progressive from the earliest stages of growth and is not limited to the later stages, when cell density is high. This acid production from glucose even under aerobic conditions serves to limit growth in broth and on solid medium, as demonstrated by the increased final cell density in medium supplemented with phosphate buffer.The conversion of a host organism to ethanolic fermentation can be used to enhance the production of a variety of recombinant products using the host\\'s expression system. The maintenance of function in these products is related to the pH of the broth during growth in dense culture. The extent of this acidification per unit of cell protein is minimized by the production of ethanol rather than of organic acids. Oxygen transfer is frequently a major limitation during the growth of dense cultures of microorganisms, and it is this limitation which results in acid production and pH drift of the growth medium. In recombinants expressing the pet operon, the ethanologenic enzymes of Z. mobilis divert part of the pyruvate from glycolysis to acetaldehyde and reoxidize NADH to produce ethanol, a less damaging product of metabolism. Strains containing both functional respiratory chains for oxidative phosphorylation and ethanol production enzymes can be grown to even higher cell densities because of the operation of both systems during the regeneration of NAD+ and a reduction in acidic waste products. Such inherent flexibility results in less stringent process-control requirements, as well as increased yields of recombinant products.Specifically, the subject invention further concerns the discovery that lactose and all of the major sugars (glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, and mannose) present in cellulose and hemicellulose could be converted to ethanol by recombinant Escherichia coli containing plasmid-borne genes encoding the enzymes for the ethanol pathway from Zymomonas mobilis. Environmental tolerances, plasmid stability, expression of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase, substrate range, and ethanol production (glucose, lactose, and xylose) were compared among 8 strains of E. coli. From these 8 strains, E. coli ATCC 9637 (pLOI297), ATCC 11303 (pLOI297) and ATCC 15244 (pLOI297) were selected for further development based upon environmental hardiness and ethanol production. Volumetric ethanol productivities per hour in batch culture were found to be approximately 1.4 g ethanol/liter for glucose (12%), 1.3 g/liter for lactose (12%), and 0.64 g/liter for xylose (8%). Ethanol productivities per hour ranged from 2.1 g ethanol/g cell dry weight with 12% glucose to 1.3 g ethanol/g cell dry weight with 8% xylose. The ethanol yield per gram of xylose was higher for recombinant E. coli than commonly reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae with glucose. Glucose (12%), lactose (12%), and xylose (8%) were converted to 7.2% ethanol (by vol.), 6.5% ethanol, and 5.2% ethanol, respectively.A variety of factors need to be considered in selecting E. coli strains suitable for ethanol production including substrate range and environmental hardiness (sugar tolerance, salt tolerance, ethanol tolerance, tolerance to low pH, and thermal tolerance). As described herein, strain ATCC 9637 (Waksman strain W) displays superior characteristics in terms of environmental hardiness, although ethanol production from glucose was lower than with other strains. Strain ATCC 9637 was selected primarily for its unique ability to utilize sucrose. Advantageously, this characteristic of ATCC 9637 makes this strain useful in the fermentation of beet sugar, cane sugar, and other feedstocks with sucrose. ATCC 11303 (Luria strain B) and ATCC 15244 (Kepes strain ML300) containing pLOI297 produced the highest levels of ethanol and exhibited acceptable levels of environmental hardiness. Plasmids were quite stable in these two constructs and they were selected as the best candidates for further development of ethanol production. Both constructs expressed the high levels of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase which are required for efficient ethanol production (Ingram et al. [1987] Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53,  supra).All major sugar components of plant biomass were converted to ethanol by recombinant E. coli containing the ethanol pathway from Z. mobilis. The conversion efficiency of glucose and xylose into ethanol exceeded that which has been previously reported for S. cerevisiae (Lovitt, R. W., B. H. Kin, G.-J. Shen, and J. G. Zeikus [1988] CRC Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 7:107-186) and pentose-fermenting yeasts systems (Beck, M. J. [1989] Biotechnol. Bioengin. Symp. 17:617-627; Jeffries, T. W., and H. K. Sreenath [1988] Biotechnol. Bioeng. 31:502-506; Skoog, K., and B. Hahn-Hagerdal [1988] Enzyme Microbiol. Technol. 10:66-79; Slininger, P. J., R. J. Bothast, M. R. Okos, and M. R. Ladisch [1985] Biotechnol. Lett. 7:431-436). Xylose was converted to ethanol by recombinant E. coli with a higher efficiency than glucose by S. cerevisiae (Lovitt et al., supra). The unusually high ethanol yields with xylose (over 100% of theoretical) may include ethanol derived from the catabolism of complex nutrients. Many amino acids and complex medium components are catabolized to glycolytic intermediates which are converted to pyruvate. This pyruvate could then be converted to ethanol.This work demonstrates that recombinants can be developed for commercial ethanol production, and it illustrates the feasibility of drastic changes in metabolic flow for the future development of novel products from microorganisms. In addition, strains containing the pet operon grow to higher cell densities than do the parent organisms under anaerobic conditions with glucose and offer the potential for the increased production of recombinant products in microorganisms while reducing complications associated with acid production.MATERIALS AND METHODSOrganisms and growth conditions. E. coli TC4 (Conway, T., Y. A. Osman, J. I. Konnan, E. M. Hoffmann, and L. O. Ingram [1987] \"Promoter and nucleotide sequences of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase,\" J. Bacteriol. 169:949-954) and plasmid-containing derivatives were used in the present study. Plasmids containing the pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pLOI276) and the alcohol dehydrogenase B gene (pLOI284) have been described previously (Conway and Osman et al. [1987], \"Promoter and nucleotide sequences . . . ,\" supra; Conway, T., G. W. Sewell, Y. A. Osman, and L. O. Ingram [1987] \"Cloning and sequencing of the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene from Zymomonas mobilis,\" J. Bacteriol. 169:2591-2597).Strains and growth conditions. Plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 (Yanisch-Perron, C., J. Vieira, and J. Messing [1985] \"Improved M13 phase cloning vectors and host strains: nucleotide sequence of the M13mp18 and pUC19 vectors,\" Gene 33:103-119), pLOI204 (Conway, T., M. O.-K. Byung, and L. O. Ingram [1987]  \"Expression vector for Zymomonas mobilis,\" Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 53:235-241), and pLOI295 (Ingram et al. [1987], supra) have been previously described. The construction and properties of pLOI292, pLOI291, pLOI297, pLOI308, pLOI308-2, pLOI308-5, and pLOI308-10 are described below.Cultures were grown at 37° C. in Luria broth (Luria, S. E. and M. Delbruck [1943] \"Mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance,\" Genetics 28:491-511) containing 50 g of glucose per liter. Cells for enzyme analyses and inocula for fermentation studies were grown in tubes (13 by 100 mm) containing 3 ml of broth at 37° C. in a tube rotator. Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh medium. Aerobic cultures (50 ml of broth in 250 ml flasks) were shaken in a reciprocating water bath (120 oscillations per min). Anaerobic cultures were grown in stoppered serum bottles (100 ml of broth in 130 ml bottles) with gyratary agitation (150 rpm) in a 37° C. incubator. Anaerobic cultures were vented with a 25-gauge needle to allow escape of gaseous fermentation products.Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically with a Spectronic 70 spectrophotometer (Bausch & Lomb, Inc., Rochester, N.Y.) at 550 nm. Disposable culture tubes (10 by 75 mm) were used as cuvettes. One absorbance unit under our conditions contained approximately 0.25 mg of cellular protein per ml. Growth was measured at A550 ; 1.0 absorbance unit is equivalent to 0.25 mg of total cell protein per ml.E. coli hosts containing the plasmids of the subject invention were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852 U.S.A.

The depositor acknowledges the duty to replace the deposits should the depository be unable to furnish a sample when requested, due to the condition of the deposits. All restrictions on the availability to the public of the subject culture deposits will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of a patent disclosing them.Genetic techniques. Transformations, plasmid constructions, DNA digestions, and analyses were carried out as previously described. Recombinants were selected on solid media (1.5% agar) containing 2 g of glucose per liter and appropriate antibiotics. Recombinants containing functional ethanologenic genes from Z. mobilis were identified by their growth as oversized colonies on Luria agar plates containing glucose and were confirmed by their poor growth on Luria agar plates lacking glucose and by the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase on aldehyde indicator medium.Enzyme assays. Cells were disrupted, heat-inactivated, and assayed for pyruvate decarboxylase activity (thermostable) as described previously (Conway and Osman et al. [1987] \"Promoter and nucleotide sequences . . . ,\" supra). Cells were prepared and assayed for alcohol dehydrogenase II activity in the direction of ethanol oxidation as described previously, except that cells were washed and disrupted in 30 mM potassium phosphate buffer to which solid ferrous ammonium sulfate (final concentration, 0.5 mM) and sodium ascorbate (10 mM) had been freshly added as described by Neale et al. (Neale, A. D., R. K. Scopes, J. M. Kelly, and R. E. H. Wettenhall [1986] \"The two alcohol dehydrogenases of Zymomonas mobilis: purification by differential dye ligand chromatography, molecular characterization and physiological role,\" Eur. J. Biochem. 154:119-124). This modification coupled with the immediate assaying of alcohol dehydrogenase activity without storage resulted in a much higher specific activity than that previously reported. Protein was measured with the Folin phenol reagent (Lowry, O. H., N. J. Rosebrough, A. L. Farr, and R. J. Randall [1951] \" Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent,\" J. Biol. Chem. 193:265-275).Analysis of fermentation products. Fermentation products were determined in clarified broth with a Millipore/Waters high-performance liquid chromatograph (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.) equipped with a refractive index monitor and an electronic integrator. Separations were performed on an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 by 7.8 mm) purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif., at 65° C. at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min (100 μl injection volume). Peaks were identified by using authentic standards. The two peaks eluting before glucose and the later unknown peak eluting at 45.4 to 45.8 min are components of uninoculated medium.Following are examples which illustrate procedures, including the best mode, for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.EXAMPLE 1Strain ConstructionThe sizes of the structural genes coding for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II are 1.7 and 1.1 kilobases, respectively, and these genes encode proteins with molecular weights of 60,000 and 40,100. These genes are each located on derivatives of pUC18 under the control of the lac promoter (FIG. 1). The two genes are combined by inserting the promoterless 1.4 kilobase fragment generated by restriction endonucleases EcoRI and SalI from pLOI284 (alcohol dehydrogenase) into the BamHI site downstream from the pyruvate decarboxylase gene in pLOI276. These clones were selected for resistance to ampicillin and for the presence and expression of alcohol dehydrogenase activity on a newly developed pararosaniline-ethanol indicator plate which detects the production of aldehydes. Clones containing the indicated construction, pLOI295, grew poorly on the surface of Luria agar plates (aerobic) in the absence of added glucose but grew to much higher densities than the plasmid-free strain and strains containing pLOI276 or pLOI284 on agar plates containing 2% glucose.Recombinants containing the pet operon were readily detected as larger, more opaque colonies on Luria agar plates (aerobic) containing glucose. This difference in colony size and opacity has proven to be a useful marker for the identification of recombinants which contain plasmids expressing both alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylate genes.The complete base sequence of pLOI295 is known. The open reading frame for the gene coding for pyruvate decarboxylase begins 163 bases downstream from the lac promoter and ends with two stop codons 85 bases upstream from the open reading frame of the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase II. Both genes include sequences which resemble ribosome-binding sites immediately upstream from each open reading frame. The gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase II contains a single stop codon followed by a palindromic sequence of 13 base pairs which serves as a transcriptional terminator.EXAMPLE 2Expression of Z. mobilis Genes in E. coliBoth pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II genes were expressed at high levels in E. coli under the control of the lac promoter singly (pLOI276 and pLOI284, respectively) and jointly. Pyruvate decarboxylase is not present in wild-type E. coli, but an inducible alcohol dehydrogenase is present at low concentrations. During growth of E. coli in the presence of glucose, the specific activities of the Z. mobilis enzymes declined by approximately 50%, which is consistent with glucose repression of the lac promoter. The specific activity of pyruvate decarboxylase, coded for by the proximal gene in the pet operon, was threefold higher in pLOI295 than in pLOI276. The specific activity of the product of the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene, the distal gene in the pet operon, was expressed in pLOI295 at twice the level in pLOI284.EXAMPLE 3Fermentation of Glucose by Recombinant StrainsExpression of the pet operon in E. coli resulted in the production of ethanol as the primary fermentation product during anaerobic growth. The parent strain produced succinate (1.5 mM), lactate (18 mM), and acetate (7 mM) as major fermentation products (FIG. 3A). An identical fermentation profile was observed in cells containing pLOI284, which carries the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (FIG. 3C). With pLOI276 carrying the gene coding for pyruvate decarboxylase, an ethanol peak is clearly evident (18 mM), equivalent to one-third of the accumulated fermentation products. This higher level of ethanol results from the combined activities of the pyruvate decarboxylase from Z. mobilis and the native E. coli alcohol dehydrogenase. With pLOI295 containing the pet operon (both pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II genes from Z. mobilis), E. coli produced large amounts of ethanol (750 mM; 4.3%, vol/vol), which represented over 95% of the fermentation products.The high levels of alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase produced in cells containing the pet operon dominated NADH oxidation in E. coli. Thus, the fermentation of this organism was converted to the equivalent of those of S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis. During normal fermentative growth, pyruvate is converted to acetyl coenzyme A by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, to oxaloacetate (and on to succinate) by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, to formate and acetyl coenzyme by pyruvate formate lyase, and to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. This last pathway is the dominant route for the regeneration of NAD+  in unmodified strains of E. coli. However, the Km s for bacterial lactate dehydrogenases are quite high, ranging from 10 to 1,000 mM (Garvie, E. I. [1980] \"Bacterial lactate dehydrogenases,\" Microbiol. Rev. 44:106-139; Tarmy, E. M., and N. O. Kaplan [1968] \"Kinetics of Escherichia coli B D-lactate dehydrogenase and evidence for pyruvate controlled change in conformation,\" J. Biol. Chem. 243:2587-2596). The Km of the pyruvate decarboxylase from  Z. mobilis is 0.4 mM (Bringer-Meyer, S., K.-L. Schimz, and H. Sahm [1986] \"Pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis: Isolation and partial characterization,\" Arch. Microbiol. 146:105-110). The abundance of this enzyme, coupled with the lower Km, effectively diverts the flow of pyruvate from glycolysis into ethanol.High cell densities are also achieved during mixed growth conditions with moderate agitation or stirring of culture vessels in which gas exchange is not restricted. Under these conditions, a final pH of 6.3 or above was observed, depending upon the extent of aeration.EXAMPLE 4Plasmid Constructions and Expression of Z. mobilis Ethanologenic Enzymes in E. coliPlasmid pLOI295 contains the Z. mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II under the control of the lac promoter. This construction is referred to as the pet operon and used as the source of ethanologenic genes for the construction of additional plasmids with alternative promoters. The EcoRI-SalI fragment from pLOI295 containing the ethanologenic genes was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to produce blunt ends. This blunt-ended DNA fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19 with the pdc gene immediately downstream from the lac promoter. The resulting plasmid, denoted pLOI293, contained the pet genes flanked by BamHI sites. Plasmids pLOI291 and pLOI292 (opposite orientations) were constructed by inserting the BamHI fragment containing the genes encoding the ethanologenic enzymes into the expression vector pLOI204. The BamHI fragment includes the ribosome-binding site, complete sequences for both genes, and a stem-loop terminator distal to adhB. In pLOI292, the two genes are expressed under the control of the Z. mobilis promoter contained in the original expression vector.Plasmid pLOI308 was constructed to remove the pet genes from the control of the lac promoter but to retain the upstream BamHI site for the insertion of alternative promoters. Partial digestion of pLOI293 with BamHI and Klenow treatment were used to remove the BamHI site distal to the adhB gene. The ethanologenic genes were removed from this plasmid as a promoterless BamHI (immediately proximal to pdc)-EcoRI (distal to adhB) fragment, which was directionally inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pUC18 to produce pLOI308. This plasmid expressed low levels of adhB on aldehyde indicator plates but did not exhibit the large-colony phenotype associated with the other functional pet plasmids pLOI295, pLOI291, and pLOI292.Chromosomal DNA from Z. mobilis was partially digested with Sau3A such that most of the DNA appeared to be less than 4 kilobases long. This unfractionated DNA was used as a source of promoter fragments and was ligated into the dephosphorylated BamHI site of pLOI308. Ampicillin-resistant recombinants with a well-expressed pet operon were identified as large colonies on Luria agar plates containing glucose. Three of the recombinant strains, pLOI308-2, pLOI308-5, and pLOI308-10, were selected for study. The Z. mobilis DNA fragments with promoter activity in these plasmids were 6, 2, and 2 kilobases long, respectively.Table 1 summarizes the activities of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in overnight cultures of the recombinant E. coli. The activities of pyruvate decarboxylase ranged from 0.37 IU/mg of cell protein in strain TC4(pLOI291) to 8.23 IU in TC4(pLOI295). In terms of pyruvate decarboxylase activity, the recombinant strains of TC4 can be ordered as follows (highest to lowest): pLOI295>pLOI308-10>pLOI308-2>pLOI308-5>pLOI292>pLOI291.

The alcohol dehydrogenase activities measured represent a combination of the native enzyme from E. coli and the Z. mobilis enzyme. The level observed in strain TC4 lacking a plasmid was relatively small in comparison to those observed in strains carrying plasmids with the Z. mobilis gene. The activities of the Z. mobilis enzyme (corrected for native E. coli alcohol dehydrogenase) ranged from 0.13 IU/mg of cell protein from strain TC4(pLOI291) to 9.6 IU in TC4(pLOI295).EXAMPLE 5Growth of Recombinant Strains Containing the Ethanologenic Enzymes From Z. mobilisShifting the catabolism of glucose to the production of ethanol also affected growth yield and pH drift of the growth medium. Although fermentation products are relatively nontoxic, they may accumulate to toxic levels during fermentation. During anaerobic growth in bottles containing Luria broth containing 10% glucose, the plasmid-free strain and the strain carrying pLOI284 (carrying the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase II) achieved a final density of 0.25 mg of cell protein per ml after 48 hr, with a final pH of 4.4. The cell density increased by twofold in the strain carrying pLOI276 (carrying the gene coding for pyruvate decarboxylase), with a final pH of 4.5. The final cell density of the strain carrying pLOI295 (pet operon) was 2.5 mg/ml, 10-fold higher than that of the control strain. The final pH was 4.7. At a density of 2.5 mg of cell protein per ml, magnesium appears to be limiting, and a 1.5-fold further increase in cell density is readily achieved by the addition of 0.5 mM magnesium sulfate.The growth of the recombinant strains was examined under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (FIG. 3). Under aerobic conditions (FIG. 3A and Table 2), strain TC4 grew with a generation time of approximately 30 min during the most rapid phase of growth. Strain TC4 carrying the derivatives of pLOI308 exhibited equivalent maximal rates of growth, with generation times between 26 and 30 min. Strain TC4(pLOI295) grew poorly under these conditions (generation time, 71 min) and was accompanied by partial lysis. Strains TC4(pLOI291) and TC4(pLOI292) grew at intermediate rates, each with a generation time of 46 min.

All of the recombinants exhibited similar maximal rates of growth, with generation times between 38 and 41 min, except for TC4(pLOI292), which grew somewhat more slowly, with a generation time of 48 min.All of the recombinants except TC4(pLOI295) grew after 12 hr under anaerobic and aerobic growth conditions to cell densities equivalent to or higher than those of strain TC4 lacking a plasmid (FIGS. 3A and B). Table 2 summarizes the final cell densities of strain TC4 and the recombinants after 24 hr of growth. Under aerobic conditions, strain TC4 containing pLOI308-10 reached the highest cell density, followed by TC4 containing pLOI308-2, pLOI292, pLOI295 (with some lysis apparent), and pLOI308-5.Under anaerobic conditions, the final cell densities of strain TC4 containing pLOI308-10 and pLOI295 were roughly equivalent, followed by those of TC4 containing pLOI292, pLOI308-2, pLOI308-5, and pLOI291.FIG. 4 shows the relationship between the level of pyruvate decarboxylase activity in cells and the final cell density after 24 hr of growth. Since the synthesis of pyruvate decarboxylase is coupled to that of alcohol dehydrogenase II in these recombinants, this plot represents the effects of the alternative Z. mobilis system for NAD+ regeneration on final cell density. From these data, it is clear that the expression of the Z. mobilis pathway for the production of ethanol increases final cell density under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In strain TC4(pLOI308-10), the levels of expression of pyruvate decarboxylase (6.5 IU) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (2.5 IU) were nearly optimal for both anaerobic and aerobic growth. The level of expression of ethanologenic enzymes in strain TC4(pLOI295) appears to be excessive, resulting in diminished cell growth accompanied by partial lysis under aerobic conditions and slightly reduced growth under anaerobic conditions.The increased growth of strain TC4(pLOI295) under anaerobic conditions with little apparent lysis in contrast to the poor growth and lysis during growth in rapidly shaken flasks suggested that a highly aerobic environment may be damaging to this construction. Lysis in this recombinant was dramatically reduced and the final cell density was increased during growth in shaken flasks when the speed of oscillation was decreased by one-third.EXAMPLE 6Effects of Ethanologenic Enzymes on the Acidification of Broth During GrowthFIG. 3C shows a plot of the changes in the pH of the broth during anaerobic growth. The pH fell rapidly during the first 6 hr of growth of strain TC4 lacking a plasmid but declined more slowly in derivatives containing the ethanologenic enzymes. Acidification during the initial 12 hr was reduced to the greatest extent in strain TC4 containing pLOI295, followed by TC4 containing pLOI308-10, pLOI308-2, and pLOI308-5. Data for strains TC4(pLOI291) and TC4(pLOI292) are not shown but lie below and above those for TC4(pLOI308-5), respectively. Although the recombinants reached a higher final cell density, the pH of the broth from the recombinants grown under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions for 24 hr was less acidic than that of the broth from strain TC4 lacking ethanologenic enzymes (Table 2).The reduced rate and extent of acidification in recombinants accompanied by increased cell growth suggested that the fall in pH was a major factor limiting growth even under highly aerobic conditions. This hypothesis was supported by an 85% increase in the final cell density of strain TC4 (lacking a plasmid) grown in medium supplemented with a 1/10 volume of 1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Lower levels of buffer addition resulted in intermediate levels of growth.EXAMPLE 7Effects of Ethanologenic Enzymes on Fermentation ProductsTable 3 summarizes the analyses of fermentation products made by strain TC4 and the recombinants after 24 hr of growth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, acetate was the primary fermentation product that accumulated during the growth of strain TC4 lacking a plasmid in rich medium, with no detectable ethanol. The amount of acetate produced was drastically reduced in strains containing the ethanologenic enzymes from Z. mobilis, and ethanol appeared as the major fermentation product. Strain TC4 containing pLOI308-10 produced the most ethanol, followed by TC4 containing pLOI295, pLOI308-2, pLOI292, pLOI308-5, and pLOI291. Under these aerobic conditions, small amounts of lactate were also produced (0.6 to 1.2 mM) by all of these strains. Only strain TC4 containing pLOI308-10 accumulated appreciable amounts of succinate, although this product still represented only 1% of the total fermentation products, with 94% being ethanol.

Lactate production was dramatically reduced in strains containing the ethanologenic enzymes and was accompanied by the production of substantial quantities of ethanol. Strain TC4(pLOI308-10) produced the largest amount of ethanol, and this product alone represented 97% of the total soluble fermentation products. The trend of ethanol production among the organisms tested was the same as that during aerobic growth. All organisms except TC4(pLOI308-10) actually produced less total ethanol after 24 hr under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. It is likely that this lower level of accumulated ethanol was caused by the reduction in total cell mass produced under these anaerobic conditions, thus reducing the volumetric rate of ethanol production.The extent of ethanol production under anaerobic and aerobic conditions (Table 3) was directly related to the level of expression of the Z. mobilis ethanologenic genes (Table 1). Ethanol production appeared to be optimal in strain TC4(pLOI308-10), with a pyruvate decarboxylase activity of 6 IU and alcohol dehydrogenase II activity of 2.5 IU.Derivatives of E. coli TC4 containing plasmids which express the ethanologenic enzymes from Z. mobilis grew to higher cell densities than did the parent organism lacking a plasmid. The increase in the final cell density, the extent to which ethanol accumulated in the medium, and the reduction in the rate of acidification of the culture broth during growth all correlated with the level of expression of Z. mobilis ethanologenic enzymes. Heterologous promoters were used to express the genes in all constructions except pLOI295 (lac) to minimize potential problems associated with transcriptional regulation. The level of expression nearest to optimal for growth and ethanol production was provided by pLOI308-10 (6.5 IU of pyruvate decarboxylase and 2.5 IU of alcohol dehydrogenase II per mg of total cellular protein). This level of expression in E. coli is considerably higher than that present in Z. mobilis CP4, which contains only the ethanol pathway for the regeneration of NAD+.The level of expression of ethanologenic enzymes appeared to be excessive in strain TC4(pLOI295)(approximately 17% of the soluble cellular protein). This high level of expression was accompanied by partial cell lysis, slower growth, and a reduction in ethanol production under aerobic conditions. These effects were reduced by slower agitation and by growth under anaerobic conditions. The apparent damage and partial lysis that occurred during highly aerobic growth may have been related to the depletion of NADH by a combination of the high levels of Z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II and the native NADH oxidase (coupled to the electron transport system).The production of ethanol as a major product does not appear to adversely affect the growth rate of E. coli TC4. Strains containing derivatives of pLOI308 (ColE1 replicon) expressing the pet operon and producing ethanol grew as rapidly as did the parent organism under aerobic conditions with glucose and reached higher final cell densities than did the parent organism. Strains containing pLOI291 or pLOI292 with the RSF1010 replicon grew more slowly under aerobic conditions. Since these two constructions expressed lower levels of the ethanologenic enzymes and produced less ethanol than did pLOI308-10, the reasons for the slower growth can be attributed to properties of the vector rather than to the expression of the pet operon.EXAMPLE 8Preparation of Additional StrainsAdditional E. coli strains were tested in order to try and identify bacteria with superior characteristics for use as an ethanol producing microbe. The following E. coli strains were evaluated: ATCC 8677, ATCC 8739, ATCC 9637, ATCC 11303, ATCC 11775, ATCC 14948, ATCC 15244, and ATCC 23227. These were grown in a shaking water bath at 30° C. in Luria broth (Luria, S. E. and M. Delbruck [1943] Genetics 28:491-511) containing tryptone (10 g/liter), yeast extract (5 g/liter), sodium chloride (5 g/liter), and a fermentable sugar. Glucose and lactose were added at concentrations of 100 g/liter and xylose at a concentration of 80 g/liter unless indicated otherwise. Sugars were autoclaved separately (121° C., 15 min), double strength in distilled water. Xylose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) solutions were acidic and were neutralized with sodium hydroxide prior to autoclaving; failure to neutralize resulted in extensive browning and decomposition. Similar fermentation results were obtained with sugars which were autoclaved or filter-sterilized. Survival in broth and on plates of recombinant strains containing genes encoding the enzymes of the ethanol pathway required the presence of a fermentable sugar. Where indicated, tetracycline was added at a final concentration of 10 mg/liter.EXAMPLE 9Environmental Hardiness of Additional StrainsPrior to the introduction of plasmids for ethanol production, the growth of the previously-identified 8 different strains of E. coli were compared for environmental hardiness. Strains were tested for their resistance to sodium chloride, sugars, low pH, and ethanol. Concentrations of sodium chloride and sugars in Table 4 include that present in the original medium. The original pH of the medium was 6.8; this was adjusted to lower values with HCl where indicated. Acidified media were sterilized by filtration. Ethanol was added to autoclaved medium after cooling. Sugars were autoclaved separately. Overnight cultures grown in each respective sugar in the absence of test agent were diluted 60-fold into 13×75 mm culture tubes containing 3 ml of test media. Growth was measured as O.D. at 550 nm after 48 hours. An O.D. of 1.0 is equivalent to 0.25 mg/ml of cell protein and 0.33 mg of cell dry weight. In tests of environmental hardiness, a final O.D. below 0.2 reflected less than two doublings and was considered negligible.Table 4 summarizes these results in medium containing glucose. Similar results were obtained in medium containing lactose or xylose. Strains ATCC 8677, ATCC 8739, and ATCC 11775 were particularly sensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of ethanol. Strains ATCC 9637 and ATCC 11775 were the most resistant to low pH although all strains grew for at least 2 to 4 doublings at pH 4.0 except ATCC 23227. All strains grew at 45° C. with limited growth at higher temperatures; none could be subcultured above 45° C. All strains grew in media containing 20% glucose, 20% lactose, or 12% xylose.

Strains which developed red colonies on MacConkey agar supplemented with 2% carbohydrate were scored positive for sugar utilization (Silhavy, T. J. and J. R. Beckwith [1985] Microbiol. Rev. 49:398-418). Cells were also tested using the Biolog EC plates (Biolog, Inc., Hayward, Calif.) according to the directions of the manufacturer. The Biolog plates were rapid and convenient, detecting NADH production (conversion of a tetrazolium salt to the insoluble formazan) as a measure of substrate utilization. Both methods were in complete agreement for the 13 sugars examined.All strains tested utilized glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, arabinose, lactose, glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid. Strain 11775 did not utilize xylose. Maltose and maltotriose were not used by ATCC 11303 and ATCC 23227. All strains exhibited a weak positive reaction with cellobiose. Only strain ATCC 9637 utilized sucrose. The results of the sugar utilization studies are shown in Table 5.

F. Fritsch, and J. Sambrook [1982] Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) which contained resistance genes for ampicillin and tetracycline as selectable markers. The ethanol production operon (PET-operon) containing a cryptic Z. mobilis promoter, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase and transcriptional terminator was removed as a 5.2 kb EcoRI fragment from pLOI308-10 (Ingram and Conway [1988], supra) and inserted into the EcoRI site of pBR322 to produce pLOI308-11. The plasmid pLOI297 was constructed by inserting the 2.6 kb EcoRI fragment from pCOS2EMBL (Poustka, A., H. R. Rackwitz, A.-M. Firschauf, and H. Lehrach [1984] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:4129-4133) containing the tetracycline resistance gene in to the SalI site of pLOI295 (Ingram et al. [1987], supra). Cohesive ends were removed by treatment with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase (Maniatis et al., supra), prior to the ligation.Plasmids were introduced into the different strains of E. coli by transformation using the calcium chloride procedure of Mandel and Higa (Mandel, M., and A. Higa [1970] J. Mol. Biol. 53:159-162). Selections were made on solid medium containing 2% glucose and tetracycline. Plasmid stability is expressed as the percentage of cells retaining antibiotic markers after 25 generations of growth in the absence of antibiotic selection.Recombinant strains harboring plasmids with the genes for ethanol production grew as unusually large colonies which became yellow after 24 to 48 hours on solid medium containing a fermentable sugar. In liquid medium, the final cell densities of these recombinants were twice to three times higher than that of the control lacking plasmid. No transformants were obtained after several attempts from ATCC 14948 with pLOI297 or from ATCC 11775 with pLOI308-11.  Strain ATCC 11775 did not utilize xylose and recombinants of this strain did not grow to higher densities than the control with xylose as the fermentable sugar, although increased growth was observed with lactose and glucose.Plasmid stability was examined after growth in medium containing glucose for 25 generations (Table 6). Both plasmids contained the same replicons and were maintained well in all strains except ATCC 8677 and ATCC 8739.

Phosphate buffer, complex medium components, and sugars were autoclaved separately and mixed after cooling. Tetracycline was included at a concentration of 10 mg/liter. Inocula were grown from freshly isolated colonies for 24 hours, washed in the fermentation medium to be tested, and added to an initial O.D. 550 nm of approximately 1.0. Fermentations were carried out at 30° C. or 37° C. in 100 ml volumetric flasks containing 80 ml of broth, fitted with rubber septa and 25 gauge needles to allow gas escape. Fermentation flasks were immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath and stirred by a magnetic stirrer at 100 rpm.Ethanol concentration was measured by gas chromatography as previously described (Dombek, K. M. and L. O. Ingram [1985] Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 51:197-200) and is expressed as percentage by volume. The conversion efficiency was calculated based upon sugar added, assuming that 100% efficiency results in the production of 12.75 ml of ethanol (10.2 g) per 20 g of glucose or xylose and 13.5 ml of ethanol (10.8 g) per 20 g of lactose.All genetically engineered strains of E. coli produced significant amounts of ethanol from sugars (Table 8). Preliminary experiments with strain ATCC 15244 (pLOI297) indicated that higher levels of ethanol were produced in medium containing 0.2M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). It is anticipated that similar or superior results would be obtained using an automated pH adjustment in place of this buffer. With 15% glucose, higher ethanol levels were produced at 30° C. than at 37° C. after 48 hours. The fermentation of lactose and xylose were examined only at the lower temperature, 30° C. In general, higher levels of ethanol were produced by strains harboring pLOI297 than with pLOI308-11. Strains ATCC 11303 (pLOI297), ATCC 11775 (pLOI297) and ATCC 15224 (pLOI297) produced the highest levels of ethanol after 48 hours from 15% glucose, 5.8% to 6.9% by volume. Most strains were less tolerant of xylose in initial experiments and comparisons of fermentation were carried out using 8% xylose. Strains ATCC 9637 (pLOI297), ATCC 11303 (pLOI297), and ATCC 15224 (pLOI297) produced the highest levels of ethanol (4.8% to 5.2%) from 8% xylose after 72 hours. All strains grew well in 15% lactose. Strains ATCC 11303 (pLOI297) and ATCC 15224 (pLOI297) produced the highest levels of ethanol from lactose after 48 hours, 6.1% and 5.6%, respectively.

The time course of growth and ethanol production were examined with both strains in 12% glucose, 12% lactose, and 8% xylose (FIG. 1). Cell mass increased approximately 10-fold, reaching a final density of 3.6 g dry weight/liter. With xylose, cell mass increased at half the rate observed with glucose or lactose. Ethanol production and growth were approximately linear for the three sugars until the concentration of ethanol reached 5%.To compute the conversion efficiency of sugar to ethanol, final ethanol concentrations after 120 hours were averaged from three sets of experiments (Table 6). The final concentration of ethanol in cultures grown with 12% glucose was 7.2% (by vol.), representing 94% of theoretical yield from glucose. With 12% lactose, the final ethanol concentration was 6.5%, 80% of the theoretical yield from lactose. With 8% xylose, we consistently obtained yields of 100% and higher. These high yields during slower growth with xylose may reflect the conversion of pyruvate from the catabolism of complex nutrients into ethanol, in addition to pyruvate from glucose.The rate of ethanol production was computed from the graphs in FIG. 1 and are summarized in Table 9. Volumetric productivity of ethanol ranged from 1.4 g/liter per hour for glucose to 0.64 g/liter per hour for xylose. Specific productivity of ethanol was highest during the initial growth period for each of the three sugars. The highest productivity was obtained with glucose, 2.1 g ethanol/g cell dry weight per hour. The highest yield of ethanol per g of sugar was obtained with xylose, exceeding the maximal theoretical yield for sugar alone.

The fibers of the invention have “cotton-like” properties but can be produced as continuous filaments on a year-round basis. The fibers are useful in textile applications.Polysaccharides have been known since the dawn of civilization, primarily in the form of cellulose, a polymer formed from glucose by natural processes via β(1→4) glucoside linkages; see, for example, Applied Fibre Science, F. Happey, Ed., Chapter 8, E. Atkins, Academic Press, New York, 1979. Numerous other polysaccharide polymers are also disclosed therein.Only cellulose among the many known polysaccharides has achieved commercial prominence as a fiber as a consequence of the many useful products derived therefrom. In particular, cotton, a highly pure form of naturally occurring cellulose, is well-known for its beneficial attributes in textile applications.It is further known that cellulose exhibits sufficient chain extension and backbone rigidity in solution to form liquid crystalline solutions; see, for example O'Brien, U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,886. The teachings of the art suggest that sufficient polysaccharide chain extension could be achieved only in β(1→4) linked polysaccharides and that any significant deviation from that backbone geometry would lower the molecular aspect ratio below that required for the formation of an ordered phase.More recently, glucan polymer characterized by α(1→3) glucoside linkages has been isolated by contacting an aqueous solution of sucrose with GtfJ glucosyltransferase isolated from Streptococcus salivarius, Simpson et al., Microbiology, vol 141, pp. 1451–1460 (1995). Highly crystalline, highly oriented, low molecular weight films of α(1→3)-D-glucan have been fabricated for the purposes of x-ray diffraction analysis, Ogawa et al., Fiber Diffraction Methods, 47, pp. 353–362 (1980). In Ogawa, the insoluble glucan polymer is acetylated, the acetylated glucan dissolved to form a 5% solution in chloroform and the solution cast into a film. The film is then subjected to stretching in glycerine at 150° C. which orients the film and stretches it to a length 6.5 times the original length of the solution cast film. After stretching, the film is deacetylated and crystallized by annealing in superheated water at 140° C. in a pressure vessel. It is well-known in the art that exposure of polysaccharides to such a hot aqueous environment results in chain cleavage and loss of molecular weight, with concomitant degradation of mechanical properties. Thus, considerable benefit would accrue to a process which would provide the high orientation and crystallinity desired for fibers without a reduction in molecular weight.It is highly desirable to discover other polysaccharides having utility as films, fibers or resins because of their widespread importance in the global ecosystem. Polysaccharides based on glucose and glucose itself are particularly important because of their prominent role in photosynthesis and metabolic processes. Cellulose and starch, both based on molecular chains of polyanhydroglucose are the most abundant polymers on earth and are of great commercial importance. Such polymers offer materials that are environmentally benign throughout their entire life cycle and are constructed from renewable energy and raw materials sources.The properties exhibited by cellulose and starch are determined by the nature of their enchainment pattern. Hence, starch or amylose consisting of α(1→4) linked glucose is not useful for fiber applications because it is swollen or dissolved by water. Alternatively, cellulose, having β(1→4) enchainment, is a good structural material being both crystalline and hydrophobic, and is commonly used for textile applications as cotton fiber. Like other natural fibers, cotton has evolved under constraints, wherein the polysaccharide structure and physical properties have not been optimized for textile uses. In particular, cotton fiber offers short fiber length, limited variation in cross section and fiber fineness and is produced in a highly labor and land intensive process.Thus, it is desirable to form new structural polysaccharides through processes such as enzymatic synthesis or through genetic modification of microorganisms or plant hosts and fibers made from such new polysaccharides that retain the desirable features of biodegradability, renewable resource-based feedstocks and low cost.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention concerns a polysaccharide fiber, comprising: a polymer comprising hexose units wherein at least 50% of the hexose units are linked via an α(1→3) glycoside linkage, said polymer having a number average degree of polymerization of at least 100.The present invention also concerns a process for producing a polysaccharide fiber, comprising the steps of: dissolving a sufficient amount of a polymer comprising hexose units, wherein at least 50% of the hexose units are linked via an α(1→3) glycoside linkage, in a solvent or in a mixture comprising a solvent to form a liquid crystalline solution, and spinning a polysaccharide fiber from said liquid crystalline solution.The present invention further concerns a liquid crystalline solution, comprising: a solvent and an amount sufficient to form liquid crystals of a polymer comprising hexose units wherein within the polymer at least 50% of the hexose units are linked via an α(1→3) glycoside linkage.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus for air gap or wet spinning of liquid crystalline solutions of hexose polymer to form polysaccharide fibers.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONIn one of the surprising aspects of the present invention, it has now been found that a polymer comprising hexose units, wherein at least 50% of the hexose units within the polymer are linked via an α(1→3) glycoside linkage, can form a liquid crystalline solution when a sufficient amount of the polymer is dissolved in a solvent or in a mixture comprising a solvent, and that from this solution can be spun a continuous, high strength, cotton-like fiber highly suitable for use in textiles either in a derivatized form, a non-derivatized form or a regenerated form. By “regenerated” is meant that any derivative groups added during the preparation of the fiber are removed.Suitable for use in the present invention are hexose polymers comprising repeating hexose monomer units wherein at least 50% of the hexose units are linked by an α(1→3) glycoside linkage. Such hexose polymers include those formed from the monomers glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, combinations thereof, and mixtures of any of the foregoing. A linkage involving a glucose monomeric unit can be called a glucoside linkage. Polyhexose polymers used herein include both the dextrorotatory (D) and levorotatory (L) enantiomers of such polymers as well as racemic mixtures thereof. Preferred are the D-forms; most preferred is D-glucose. A racemic mixture is less preferred.By “α(1→3) glycoside linkage” is meant that within the polymer, the repeating monomeric units are linked in a particular manner dictated by an enchainment pattern. The nature of the enchainment pattern depends, in part, on how the ring closes when an aldohexose ring closes to form a hemiacetal. The open chain form of glucose (an aldohexose) has four asymmetric centers (see below). Hence there are 24 or 16 possible open chain forms of which D and L glucose are two. When the ring closes, there is a new asymmetric center created at C1 thus making 5 asymmetric carbons. Depending on how the ring closes, for glucose, α(1→4)-linked polymer, e.g. starch or β(1→4)-linked polymer, e.g. cellulose can be formed upon further condensation to polymer. The configuration at C1 in the polymer determines whether it is an alpha or beta linked polymer, and the numbers in parenthesis following alpha or beta refer to the carbon atoms through which enchainment takes place. \\nThe polymer used to form the polysaccharide fiber of the present invention possesses a number average degree of polymerization of at least 100 and can range up to about 5,000. Preferably, the number average degree of polymerization ranges from about 200 to about 1,000.The polysaccharides of the present invention can be homoglycans or heteroglycans. If only one type of hexose unit is used during preparation of the polysaccharide, a homoglycan is formed. Glucan is a homoglycan formed from glucose. If more than one type of hexose unit is used, a heteroglycan is formed.The polymer of the polysaccharide fibers of the present invention can further comprise monomer units other than hexose units, such as pentoses. It is preferred that substantially all of the monomer units within the polymer in the present invention are hexose monomer units. By “substantially all” is meant at least 90%.In a similar vein, the polysaccharide fibers of the present invention can further comprise monomer units linked by a glycoside linkage other than α(1→3), such as α(1→4), α(1→6), β(1→2), β(1→3), β(1→4) or β(1→6) or any combination thereof. At least 50% of the glycoside linkages in the polymer are an α(1→3) glycoside linkage. Preferably, substantially all of the linkages are α(1→3) glycoside linkages, and most preferably all of the hexose units in the polymer are linked by an α(1→3) glycoside linkage. By “substantially all” is meant at least 90%.The polysaccharide fibers of the present invention are produced by dissolving the polymer, described above, in a solvent or in a mixture comprising a solvent, to form a liquid crystalline solution. Oriented fiber is then spun from the liquid crystalline solution.The isolation and purification of various polysaccharides is described in, for example, The Polysaccharides, G. O. Aspinall, Vol. 1, Chap. 2, Academic Press, New York, 1983. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, poly(α(1→3)-D-glucose) is formed by contacting an aqueous solution of sucrose with GtfJ glucosyltransferase isolated from Streptococcus salivarius according to the methods taught in the art. Any method which results in a purity of ca. 90% or greater is satisfactory. One such method is provided in detail hereinbelow.The polymer comprising hexose units can be derivatized, preferably acetylated, most preferably close to 100% acetylated, in order to facilitate rendering the polysaccharide soluble in the spinning solvent to achieve a solids level sufficient for liquid crystals to form. For examples of representative polysaccharide derivatives useful herein, see The Polysaccharides, G. O. Aspinall, Vol. 2, Chap. 2, Academic Press, New York, 1983. Preferred derivatives include methyl, ethyl, hydroxyethyl, nitrate, acetate, proprionate and butyrate. A preferred derivatized polymer is a poly(α(1→3)-D-glucose acetate). Acetylation can be accomplished using the method described by O'Brien, op.cit., for acetylating cellulose. It can be useful to pre-activate the hexose polymer by first contacting it with acetic acid prior to its contact with an acetylation mixture such as a mixture of glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and methylene chloride. Contact with the mixture is followed by the addition of perchloric acid to initiate esterification.Following optional formation of the derivative, the polymer is dissolved in a solvent or in a mixture comprising a solvent to form a liquid crystalline solution. By “liquid crystalline solution” is meant a solution in which a spontaneous phase separation from randomly dispersed polymer molecules to domains of locally ordered molecules has occurred. Formation of the liquid crystalline solution is dependent on the solids content of the polymer so dissolved. “Solids content” refers to the amount of dry polymer before it is dissolved. It is calculated as the (wt. of polymer)/(wt. of polymer+wt. of solvent). A liquid crystalline solution must be formed in order to obtain an oriented fiber when the solution is spun. The amount of polymer needed to provide a solids content sufficient for liquid crystals to form depends on the polymer morphology and the polymer molecular weight. The onset of liquid crystallinity can be determined by an observable increase in the birefringence of the solution being formed. Birefringence can be determined by any convenient means as are known in the art.Non-derivatized polymers and the derivatized polymers formed as described above are soluble in solvents including organic halides, organic acids, fluorinated alcohols, or mixtures thereof. Representative of such solvents are methylene chloride (dichloromethane), trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, formic acid, hexafluoroisopropanol, and mixtures such as trifluoroacetic acid/methylene chloride, trichloroacetic acid/methylene chloride, dichloroacetic acid/methylene chloride, and formic acid/methylene chloride. Other suitable solvents include molecules which are nonsolvents by themselves (e.g., water) in combination with strong organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid/water, trichloroacetic acid/water, dichloroacetic acid/water, or formic acid/water. Preferably, an acetylated polymer is dissolved in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and methylene chloride, most preferably as a 60/40 v/v. mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and methylene chloride, respectively, at a temperature between about 0 and about 25° C. while mixing, preferably mixing under high shear.The particular benefits of the present invention are achieved by virtue of the formation of the liquid crystalline solution comprising a solvent and an amount sufficient to form liquid crystals of a polymer comprising hexose units wherein at least 50% of the hexose units are linked via an α(1→3)glycoside linkage from which a highly oriented, highly crystalline continuous filament can be drawn. A preferred liquid crystalline solution is one wherein substantially all of the hexose units are linked via an α(1→3)glycoside linkage. A preferred polymer for a liquid crystalline solution is poly(α(1→3)-D-glucose acetate). One of skill in the art will understand that the minimum polymer concentration (solids content) required for achieving the formation of the liquid crystalline phase will vary according to the specific molecular morphology and the molecular weight of the polymer. A liquid crystalline solution having a solids content of at least 10% is preferred. A solids content ranging from about 10% to about 35% is more preferred herein, and most preferred is about 20 to about 35%. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it has been found that the minimum polymer concentration for phase separation of 100% poly(α(1→3)-D-glucose) is ca. 15% by weight in a 60/40 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and methylene chloride when the number average molecular weight of the polymer is ca. 60,000 Daltons. Optimum spinning performance for this particular polymer is achieved at about 20 to about 30% by weight solids content, which is most preferred.Spinning from the liquid crystalline solution can be accomplished by means known in the art, and as described in O'Brien, op.cit. The viscous spinning solution can be forced by means such as the push of a piston or the action of a pump through a single or multi-holed spinneret or other form of die. The spinneret can be of any cross-sectional shape, including round, flat, multi-lobal, and the like, as are known in the art. The extruded strand can then be passed by ordinary means into a coagulation bath wherein is contained a liquid which dissolves the solvent of the spinning solvent but not the polymer thereof, thus causing the highly oriented polymer to coagulate into a fiber according to the present invention.Under some circumstances, a superior result is achieved when the extruded strand first passes through an inert, noncoagulating layer, usually an air gap, prior to introduction into the coagulation bath. When the inert layer is an air gap, the spinning process is known as air-gap spinning. Under other circumstances, extrusion directly into the coagulation bath is preferred, known as wet-spinning. Preferred solvents for the coagulation bath include aliphatic alcohols, particularly methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol.FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus for wet or air-gap spinning of polysaccharide fibers. Syringe pump 1 drives ram 2 at a controlled rate onto piston 3 of spinning cell 4. A suitable syringe pump is a Harvard model 44. Spinning cell 4 can contain a metal filter, such as a Dynalloy® X5, 10 μm sintered metal filter, above spinneret 6. Extrudate 12 is optionally directed through an inert non-coagulating layer and into liquid coagulating bath 8 and directed back and forth between guides 7 which, for example, can be ceramic or comprise Teflon® fluoropolymer. On exiting the coagulation bath, the extrudate can be optionally directed through a drawing zone between two independently driven rolls 9 and collected on bobbins, preferably stainless steel, at wind-up 11.If in a derivatized form, the polysaccharide fibers of the present invention can be retained in such derivatized form. However, it is preferred to regenerate such fibers by converting them back to the hydroxyl reconstituted form. This can be accomplished by numerous means known in the art, such as by contacting the polysaccharide fiber with an excess of a saponification or hydrolysis medium. One deacetylation means found to be satisfactory herein is base-catalyzed saponification. For example, the acetylated fiber can be contacted with 0.05 molar methanolic sodium methoxide, or with a dilute aqueous base solution, such as 5% aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide, for 24–72 hours at room temperature, to remove ester groups, such as the acetyl group.It is quite surprising that poly(α(1→3)-D-glucose) forms liquid crystalline solutions, and that the highly desirable fibers of the present invention can be spun therefrom. Likewise for other polyhexoses comprising at least 50% α(1→3) glycoside linkages in combination with other non preferred linkages, liquid crystalline behavior can be observed. For example, Nigeran which includes α(1→3) and α(1→4) glycoside linkages can be dissolved in a solvent to form a liquid crystalline solution. However, other α-linked polyglucoses, especially those containing substantially all α(1→6) or α(1→4) linkages, and more generally other α-linked polysaccharides do not exhibit similar behavior, for example amylose (starch) which has α(1→4) linkages, dextran with α(1→6) linkages, and pullulan with α(1→4) and α(1→6) linkages.The white, lustrous fibers of the present invention are characterized by a tensile strength of at least 1 gram per denier, preferably 2 grams per denier.EXAMPLESPolymer IsolationIn the examples following, except Example 7, two batches of poly(α(1→3)-D-glucose) were employed, designated P1 and P2.P1 was produced according to the following sequence. The mature peptide encoded by the gtf-J gene of Streptococcus salivarius (strain ATCC 25975) was cloned by PCR amplification of template DNA from Streptococcus salivarius using primers based on the gene sequence described in Genbank accession number Z11873 and by Giggard et al., J. Gen. Microbiol. 137 (Pt 11), 2577–2593 (1991).PCR reactions were run using the 5′ primer SEQ ID NO:1:\\n5′-GGGAATTCCATATGAACATTGATGGTAAATATTAC\\n\\nwhere SEQ ID NO:2, the sequence:\\nAACATTGATGGTAAATATTAC\\n\\ncorresponds to bases 555 through 547 of Genbank accession number Z11873 and the remaining 5′ bases provide an Nde I recognition site and a few 5′ bases to allow digestion of the PCR product with Nde I.\\n\\nThe 3′ primer SEQ ID NO:3 had the sequence (read 5′ to 3′)\\n5′-AGATCTAGTCTTAGTTTAGCACTCTAGGTGG\\n\\nwhere SEQ ID NO:4 the sequence:\\nTTAGTTTAGCACTCTAGGTGG\\n\\ncorresponds to the reverse compliment of bases 4559 through 4580 in Genbank accession number Z11873 and the remaining bases provide an Xba I site and extra bases to allow digestion of the PCR product with Xba I.\\n\\nThe PCR product was digested with Nde I and Xba I then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and isolated. The fragment was ligated into the E. coli protein expression vector pET24a (Novagen) that had been digested with Nde I and Nhe I. The ligation reaction was used to transform E. coli cell line DH10B, and six clonal colonies from that transformation were grown and plasmid DNA was isolated. The plasmid DNA from each of these lines was used to transform E. coli cell line DE3.Single colonies from each transformation were grown overnight in rich media, the resultant culture was diluted to about 0.05 optical density units at 600 nm and then re-grown to 2 optical density units at 600 nm then protein expression from the pET24a plasmid was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 3 hr, re-suspended in 50 mM KPO4 buffer at pH 6 which also contained 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication.Clonal cultures producing active dextran sucrase were identified by adding 10 ml of the cell extract to 50 mM sucrose and 0.5 mg ml-1 T-10 dextran (Sigma) in a total reaction volume of 100 ml of 50 mM KPO4 buffer. Active clones producing enzyme polymerize glucose using sucrose as the glucosyl donor and producing insoluble polymer thus clouding the reaction solution within about 10 minutes. The polymer was lyophilized to form a dry powder.P2 was produced in a larger scale modification of the process for producing P1. Production of the crude enzyme was done by scaling the procedure employed for the production of P1 to two one-liter cultures in shake flasks. Isolated cells were disrupted by French Press disruption using the buffer system described above. The cell extract was diluted to 10 mg of protein ml-1, brought to 30% saturation with ammonium sulfate and centrifuged to remove a small amount of precipitate. The supernatant was brought to 70% saturation in ammonium sulfate and the precipitated protein isolated by centrifugation. The protein pellet was stored as a suspension in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate and used as the suspension.Poly (α(1→3)-D-glucose) was produced by adding the ammonium sulfate suspension to a 2 1 solution of 200 mM sucrose in 50 mM KPO4 buffer pH 6 and stirring overnight at 28° C. The insoluble glucose polymer produced was removed from solution by centrifugation, re-suspended in water (500 ml) and again centrifuged. The water wash was repeated two more times and the centrifuge pellet was concentrated by vacuum filtration on a sintered glass filter. The filter cake was stored at 4° C. prior to use.Testing MethodsPhysical properties such as tenacity, elongation and initial modulus were measured using methods and instruments conforming to ASTM Standard D 2101-82, except that the test specimen length was one inch. Reported results are averages for 3 to 5 individual filament tests.Example 12.86 g of wet polymer P2 was boiled in 150 ml deionized water for 1 h. After cooling, the product was collected by filtration and washed 3× with glacial acetic acid. The polymer, still wet with acetic acid, was suspended in a prechilled (−25° C.) acetylating mixture consisting of acetic anhydride (20 ml), glacial acetic acid (14 ml) and methylene chloride (20 ml). Mechanical stirring was started and 70% aqueous perchloric acid (0.2 ml) was added to initiate esterification. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0° C. and held there for 3 h. The reaction mixture was subsequently allowed to warm to room temperature and held for 1 h, then frozen in dry ice overnight, and then warmed to room temperature again.The viscous, homogeneous solution of thus acetylated P2 polymer was precipitated in methanol with rapid stirring and collected by filtration. The filtrate was thoroughly washed twice with methanol, then five times with deionized water, and then four times with methanol. The washed product was collected by filtration and allowed to air dry yielding 1.78 g of purified acetylated polymer which was soluble in methylene chloride. Size exclusion chromatography in hexafluoroisopropanol containing 0.1 M sodium triflate was conducted through two Showdex 80M columns yielding relative molecular weight values of Mn=60,800 and Mw=202,300.1.5 g of the thus prepared α(1→3) glucan acetate was combined with 2.79 g of a solvent mixture consisting of 100 parts by weight trifluoroacetic acid (99%) and 8 parts by weight deionized water to form a 35% solids solution. In order to dissolve the polymer therein, the mixture of polymer and solvent was first stirred by hand using a stainless steel spatula in order to homogenize the mixture. The homogenized mixture was then pumped back and forth between two syringes connected by a short length of 3 mm ID stainless steel tubing. Dissolution of the polymer in the solvent mixture was complete within 4 h at room temperature. The solution was examined microscopically through crossed polarizers and found to be highly birefringent, confirming an oriented, lyotropic liquid crystalline phase.The liquid crystalline solution so formed was transferred into a vertically positioned polyethylene syringe fitted with a Dynalloy® X5 sintered stainless steel filter available from Fluid Dynamics/Memtec Group, Deland, Fla. Trapped air was allowed to migrate to the top of syringe and vented during installation of the syringe plunger. This assembly was then fitted to a vertically mounted Harvard model 55-1144 syringe pump for controlled rate extrusion according to the parameters given in Table 1. The syringe was fitted with a stainless steel single hole spinneret having a hole diameter of 0.005 inches and capillary length of 0.010 inches. The face of the spinneret was maintained 0.5 inches above the surface of the methanol coagulation bath. The filament was extruded at 20 ft/min, drawn into the bath and directed around ceramic guides at both ends of the coagulation tray to obtain a total travel in the bath of 14 feet. (See FIG. 1) The coagulated fiber, still wet with methanol, was wound onto stainless steel bobbins at 58 ft/min. The bobbins were soaked in methanol overnight and the filaments were allowed to air dry before mechanical testing. As spun filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 4.2/17.5/53.9 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Example 2The as-spun fiber of Example 1 was deacetylated to yield regenerated poly (α(1→3)-D-glucose) fibers with good mechanical properties. A small skein of the fiber of Example 1 was immersed in a large excess of 0.05M methanolic sodium methoxide and allowed to stand at room temperature for 24–72 h under nitrogen. The skein was removed, washed with methanol, blotted and air dried. Filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 2.7/12.5/51.3 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Example 31.0 g of dried powder of P1 polymer was suspended in deionized water and boiled under nitrogen for 2 h. After cooling, the powder was collected by filtration and pressed to yield a wet filter cake. This was subsequently immersed in 100 ml of glacial acetic acid, stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature and collected by filtration. The acetic acid rinse was repeated and the powder was collected and pressed to remove excess acetic acid.The filter cake was then added to a chilled (−25° C.) acetylation medium consisting of acetic anhydride (10 ml, 99.7%), glacial acetic acid (7 ml) and dichloromethane (10 ml). Perchloric acid (0.1 ml, 70%) was added and the reaction maintained with stirring at a temperature in the range of −30° C. to −2° C. for 6 h and then allowed to warm to 24° C. and held for 30 min. The resulting viscous mixture was precipitated into rapidly stirred methanol and then filtered. The filter cake was then washed once with methanol, followed by two washings with deionized water and then once with acetone. After drying, the yield was 1.2 g of purified acetylated polymer in the form of an off-white flake.1 g of the thus prepared acetylated polymer was suspended in 3 g of a 60%/40% by volume mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (99%) and dichloromethane. After the polymer was dispersed in the solvent, the solution was mixed as described in Example 1. The resulting solution was lyotropic and highly fiber forming. The thus formed liquid crystalline solution was transferred to a polyethylene syringe fitted with a filter and extruded using the same general procedure as for Example 1. The filament was extruded at 10.4 fpm through a 0.5 inch air gap into methanol (bath length=13 ft) and wound up at 36 ft/min. As-spun filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 1.6/11.7/34.5 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Example 4A 6″ skein of the as-spun filament of Example 3 was prepared from 5 wraps of continuous filament and the ends were tied together. A 50 g weight was suspended from the bottom of the skein (consisting of 10 total filaments) and the assembly was immersed in a large excess of 0.05 m methanolic sodium methoxide and maintained under nitrogen for 96 h. The filament was removed, washed by immersion in fresh methanol and allowed to air dry. The thus regenerated or deacetylated filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 2.4/13.0/52.2 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Example 5Poly (α(1→3)-D-glucose) acetate fibers were prepared as described in Example 3, except that the wind-up speed was 23 ft/min and the coagulation bath temperature was 3° C. As-spun filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 1.9/14.2/32.7 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Example 6Polymer P1 (2.0 g) was added as a dried powder to a chilled (0° C.) mixture of glacial acetal acid (99%, 14 ml), acetic anhydride (99.7%, 10 ml) and dichloromethane (20 ml). The reactants were kept under nitrogen and a catalyst solution at 0° C. of perchloric acid (70% aqueous, 0.2 ml) in acetic anhydride (10 ml) was added dropwise with rapid stirring. After addition of the catalyst solution, the reactants were allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 5 h. The amber-colored viscous solution thus formed was precipitated into methanol. The filter cake was washed twice with methanol, collected by filtration and vacuum dried at 50° C. to yield 2.65 (g) of off-white polymer flake.1.0 g of the thus acetylated polymer was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane (60/40 v/v, 4.0 g) and mixed using the method of Example 1. The resulting solution was lyotropic and fiber forming. Extrusion was carried out using the general procedures described in Example 1, and the specific conditions in Table 1 below, except that it was wet-spun. As-spun filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 0.94/14.4/23.1 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Example 7Nigeran (an alternating α(1→3), α(1→4) glucan), 0.86 g (from Asperigillus japonicus, Cat #N2888, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was suspended in 50 ml of glacial acetic acid for 20 min and collected by filtration. This step was repeated once more and the starting material (still wet with acetic acid) was added to a three necked flask containing the acetylation medium prechilled to 2° C. and fitted with a thermocouple, stirrer and nitrogen inlet tube. The acetylation medium consisted of acetic anhydride (20 ml), glacial acetic acid (14 ml) and methylene chloride (20 ml). Perchloric acid, (0.2 ml, 70% aqueous) was then added dropwise with rapid stirring while maintaining the temperature between 2–5° C. The reaction was maintained at this temperature for 3 h and subsequently allowed to warm to room temperature for an additional 3 h. The acetylated polymer was then isolated by precipitation into methanol, and collected by filtration. Additional washings with methanol (2 times) were conducted yielding 0.96 g of a white product.A 30% solids solution of the above polymer in trifluoroacetic acid/water (100/8 w/w) was prepared and observed to be birefringent when viewed through crossed polarizing filters verifying the existence of a liquid crystalline solution.Comparative Example 10.5 g of the purified acetylated polymer of Example 6 was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane (60/40 v/v, 2.8 g) using the method of Example 1. The resulting solution was not lyotropic (a liquid crystalline solution did not form) because the solids content was below the critical concentration for liquid crystalline phase separation, and was poorly fiber forming. Filament extrusion was carried out as described for Example 4 and the specific conditions in Table 1. As-spun fibers were soaked in methanol for 24 h before being dried and tested. As-spun filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 0.54/17.2/17.4 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Comparative Example 2A skein of the as-spun filament of Comparative Example 1 was deacetylated in 0.05 m methanolic sodium methoxide using the procedure described in Example 2. Filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 0.4/2.5/25.1 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively. Thus, regeneration of the poorly oriented isotropically spun precursor fiber gave a poor fiber.Comparative Example 3Preparation of Debranched Amyloseα(1→6) branch points were enzymatically removed from common corn starch as follows. 300 g of corn starch was gelatinized by heating in 8 L of water at 100° C. for 1 hour. The gelatinized starch was cooled to 50° C. and 50 ml of 1 M acetic acid was added to adjust the pH to about 4. 1 million units of isoamylase (Sigma) were added in 25 ml of sodium acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 4.5) and the mixture was incubated at 45° C. for 4 hours.1.2 L of butanol was added to the above reaction mixture, and the mix was boiled for 1 hour. The mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature slowly overnight. The mixture was further cooled to 5° C. and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (GS-3 Rotor, 9500 rpm, 30 minutes). The collected precipitate was resuspended in 8 L water, boiled for 30 minutes and precipitated a second time as above. After centrifugation the precipitate was washed with ethanol and dried overnight at 50° C. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was used to compare the resulting product with debranched starch before precipitation verifying removal of the short amylopectin branches.Preparation of poly(α(1→4)-D-glucose)acetate (Polymer D)Enzymatically debranched amylose from cornstarch (5.0 g), α(1→4)-D-glucose, was suspended in 100 ml water and boiled for 1 h under nitrogen. On cooling, the suspension was cooled to 0° C. and the swollen starch granules were collected by filtration. The wet filter cake was washed 4× with glacial acetic on the filter and the acid-exchanged filter cake was pressed to remove excess acetic acid. This was added to a reaction flask equipped with a paddle stirrer and charged with acetic anhydride (99.7%, 200 ml), acetic acid (99%, 70 ml) and dichloromethane (100 ml), all prechilled to 2° C. Perchloric acid (70% aqueous, 0.5 ml) was added dropwise while maintaining an ice bath around the reaction vessel. After 2 h the reaction mixture was clear and was precipitated by pouring into rapidly stirred methanol. The white product was washed twice in methanol and dried in vacuum at 50° C. The yield was 6.5 g of poly (α(1→4)-D-glucose acetate) which was readily soluble in dichloromethane and mixtures of trifluoroacetic acid with dichloromethane or water.A 1.0 g portion of the thus acetylated polymer was dissolved in dichloromethane (4.0 g). The viscous solution was not liquid crystalline as evidenced by the absence of birefringence when viewed through crossed polarizers. The fiber forming solution was extruded using the general procedures for Example 1 and the specific parameters in Table 1. The extrudate was not sufficiently strong to allow for several passages through the coagulation bath and best spinning continuity was observed without the use of an air gap. As-spun filament tenacity/elongation/modules values were 0.5/70.6/13.9 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.Comparative Example 41.5 g of the acetylated poly (α(1→4)-D-glucose) of Comparative Example 3 was dissolved in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and water (4.5 g) 100/8 w/w to provide a 25% solids solution. The resulting spin dope was not liquid crystalline as evidenced by the absence of birefringence when viewed through crossed polarizers. The solution was transferred to a 5 ml syringe fitted with a scintered metal filter and extruded through 0.25 inch air gap using the general procedures of Example 1 and the specific parameters in Table 1. As in Comparative Example 2, the spinning threadline was not sufficiently strong to allow multiple passes in the coagulation bath. The as-spun fiber exhibited a dull appearance and measured filament tenacity/elongation/modulus values were 0.3/14.7/12.6 grams per denier/percent/grams per denier, respectively.TABLE 1PolymerDiaPumpJetSpeedConcen.HolesHoleRateVelLengthTempAirgap(fpm)S.S.F.*SourcePolymerSolvent% Solids(in.)L/dMl/minFpm(ft)(° C.)(in.)WIND-UPEx. 1α(1-3) glucan acetateTFA/H2O 100/8 w/w350.00520.082014−10.5582.9Ex. 2α(1-3) glucanSAPONIFIEDEx. 3α(1-3) glucan acetateTFA/CH2Cl2 60/40 v/v250.00520.0410.361390.5363.5Ex. 4α(1-3) glucanSAPONIFIED UNDERTENSIONEx. 5α(1-3) glucan acetateTFA/CH2Cl2 60/40 v/v250.00520.0410.361330.5232.2Ex. 6α(1-3) glucan acetateTFA/CH2Cl2 60/40 v/v200.00550.0820.725170291.4Comp.α(1-3) glucan acetateTFA/CH2Cl2 60/40 v/v150.00540.0820.725180150.7Ex. 1Comp.α(1-3) glucanSAPONIFIEDEx. 2Comp.α(1-4) glucan acetateCH2Cl2200.00520.08200.91230150.7Ex. 3Comp.α(1-4) glucan acetateTFA/H2O 100/8 w/w250.00540.0851.08200.25482.4Ex. 4*Spin Stretch Factor\", 'pn_kind': 'B1', 'apn_num': '09857572', 'apn_original': 'US09857572', 'title_en': 'Polysaccharide fibers', 'legal_info': \"ASSIGNMENTOwner name DUPONT INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES USA, LLC, DELAWAREfree format text CORRECTIVE ASSIGNMENT TO CORRECT THE ENTITY TYPE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AT REEL: 049879 FRAME: 0043.

Accordingly, the present invention claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §§119(e), 120, 121, and/or 365(c) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/610,275, entitled “Replenishing Windshield Washer”, filed on Mar. 13, 2012. The contents of which the above referenced application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method of replenishing and conditioning the fluid within a windshield washing system. In particular, to an apparatus which can recover rainwater, dew and recapture dispensed fluids from the windshield of a vehicle to replenish and condition the fluid within a windshield washing system.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONWindshield cleaning systems are old and well known in the art. Most of them employ a reservoir containing a fluid, such as water. The water can include an additive which will prevent the water from freezing in the colder climates. This additive is commonly known as a deicer. The deicer can also remove ice that has formed on the windshield of a vehicle. Other additives to the fluid reservoir include substances which enhance the cleaning properties of the water/fluid in the reservoir, such as all season windshield cleaner, all season windshield cleaner and deicer, rain repellant with or without all season cleaner or all season windshield cleaner and deicer.In the winter months, when slush and other substances from the roads splash up onto the windshield of vehicles, the operator of the vehicle utilizes the windshield washer system repeatedly to clean the windshield to provide a clear view for driving. This high use of the windshield washer system can and normally does result in all of the fluid in the windshield washer reservoir being used up rapidly. If the vehicle operator is not vigilant in maintaining the washer reservoir full of fluid, the operator may be without the ability to clean the windshield when the need arises. Thus there is a need to provide a system and method of readily replenishing the fluid in a windshield washer reservoir without the vehicle operator constantly monitoring the fluid in the windshield washer reservoir.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTU.S. Pat. No. 2,701,897 discloses a windshield cleaning system using water from the cooling system of an automobile. A metered amount of detergent is placed into the dispersed fluid.U.S. Pat. No. 2,770,017 discloses a method of automatically replenishing the supply of liquefied solvent to the reservoir of a windshield washer. A trough or pipe line leads from the ventilating duct in the cowl as a means for recovering rainwater.U.S. Pat. No. 3,738,575 discloses an automatic windshield washer for a vehicle of the type having a reservoir and spray nozzles. Means are provided to collect rain water and car wash water from the outer surface of the vehicle and means to feed the collected water to the reservoir. The valve means can trap sediment and add cleaning agents to the collected water.U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,254 discloses a method and apparatus for self-replenishment of the solution contained within an automobile windshield washer system. Water is extracted from air such as through the use of a desiccant system in combination with an automobile air conditioning system. This water is combined with a stored concentrated anti-freeze liquid in a preselected ratio to produce a windshield washer solution having sufficient freezing point depression for use during winter weather conditions.U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,669,986 and 6,024,803 disclose the use of rainwater on a vehicle to clean collection surfaces which have been contaminated with agents such as road salt and for storage in a reservoir for later use in windshield washing.U.S. Pat. No. 6,266,842 discloses a windshield cleaning device for a windshield of a motor vehicle. A collecting device is provided for collecting and returning excess sprayed cleaning liquid, spray water, and rain water into the windshield fluid reservoir. A heat exchanger is provided for heating the cleaning liquid pumped by the pump by heat energy derived from the cooling water cooling the motor of the motor vehicle. A control circuit measures at least one temperature that can be the ambient temperature or the temperature of the cleaning liquid and allows pumping of the cleaning liquid onto the windshield only above a set temperature limit. A metering device automatically introduces an alcohol mixture, and optionally surface-active agents, into the cleaning liquid based on the measured temperature.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONA system and method of collecting rainwater and other moisture, such as dew, from a windshield of a vehicle and conditioning the collected fluid to replenish the windshield washer reservoir. One or more collection funnels are located at various locations on a vehicle. Rainwater and other fluids from these funnels are directed to a fluid conditioning cartridge. The fluid conditioning cartridge includes quick connect fittings to allow the cartridge to be a single replaceable unit.Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a system that collects fluids and utilizes these fluids to replenish the fluids in a windshield washer reservoir of a vehicle.It is a further objective of the present invention to collect rain or dew on windshields to condition and replenish the fluids in a windshield washer reservoir of a vehicle.It is yet another objective of the present invention to collect rain or dew on various parts of a vehicle to replenish the fluids in a windshield washer reservoir of a vehicle.It is a still further objective of the present invention to provide a disposable fluid conditioning cartridge to condition the fluids in a windshield washer reservoir of a vehicle.It is still yet a further objective of the present invention to collect rain, dew, or melting snow/ice on windshield wipers and to collect rain, dew, or melting snow/ice on various portions of a vehicle to replenish the fluids in a windshield washer reservoir of a vehicle.It is still yet a further objective of the present invention to provide a replaceable mixing cartridge between the collection point of rain, dew, or other fluids and a windshield washer reservoir. Fluid additives may be added to the collected fluids in the mixing cartridge and the resulting fluid delivered to a pre-existing windshield washer reservoir on a vehicle.Other objectives and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with any accompanying drawings wherein are set forth, by way of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention.

In a preferred embodiment, the wick 52 is further defined as a tape style wick comprised of wool, synthetic, cotton, polyester or any other suitable wick material with passageways therein that distribute the windshield washer fluid concentrate by capillary action to the mixing chamber 50. However, metering pumps and other devices can be utilized to deliver the windshield washer fluid concentrate to the mixing chamber 50.In a preferred embodiment, the concentrate chamber 60 has a conduit channel 54 constructed and arranged to extend into the mixing chamber 50. The wick 52 passes through the conduit channel 54 and extends into the mixing chamber. The windshield washer fluid concentrate formulation is formulated for pass through of the passageways in the wick 52 without clogging or blocking.The wick is fluidly attached to a pad 56 in the mixing chamber. The pad 56 is constructed and arranged to provide optimal mixing between the windshield washer concentrate and the water. The pad 56 can be comprised of wool, synthetic, cotton, polyester or any suitable wick material know to someone of ordinary skill in the art.The fluid is transported from the collection reservoir to the ion exchange resin by tubing 73 or other fluid conduits. The fluid coupling between the collection funnel and the ion exchange resin chamber is releasably secured by use of quick connect 70. The conditioned and mixed fluid is transported from the mixing chamber to the existing windshield washer reservoir by tubing 75 or other fluid conduits. The fluid coupling between the mixing chamber and the existing windshield water reservoir is releasably secured by use of quick connect 71.All of the tubing or fluid conduit are made from plastic materials in a preferred embodiment. However, they can be made from any type of material which can transport fluids without being affected by the fluids.The ion exchange resin chamber 40, the mixing chamber 50, and the concentrate chamber 60 forms a single replaceable cartridge assembly 16. The cartridge assembly 16 can be reconditioned for reuse and the concentrate can be interchanged with different compositions. The cartridge assembly includes a sight glass 62 in said concentrate chamber.All patents and publications mentioned in this specification are indicative of the levels of those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.

No. 61/099,705, filed on Sep. 24, 2008, to which priority is claimed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §119(e) and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to detecting disordered breathing using a minute ventilation-based detection methodology.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSleep is generally beneficial and restorative to a patient, exerting great influence on the quality of life. A typical night's sleep for a normal person begins with a sleep stage known as slow wave sleep (SWS) characterized by low frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. As the person falls asleep, brain activity declines and there is a progressive increase in the depth of sleep. At approximately ninety minute intervals, sleep lightens and a sleep stage known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is initiated. REM sleep is characterized by high frequency EEG activity, bursts of rapid eye movements, skeletal muscle atonia, and heightened autonomic activity.There are typically 4-6 REM periods per night, with increasing duration and intensity toward morning. While dreams can occur during either REM or SWS sleep, the nature of the dreams varies depending on the type of sleep. REM sleep dreams tend to be more vivid and emotionally intense than SWS sleep dreams. Furthermore, autonomic nervous system activity is dramatically altered when REM sleep is initiated.In patients with respiratory or heart disease, the brain during sleep can precipitate breathing disturbances, myocardial ischemia, or arrhythmia. Although REM sleep is a necessary component of normal sleep, serious consequences may be associated with both the increase in autonomic activity and the intense emotional responses that accompany dreaming in patients with cardiovascular disease or respiratory disorders, for example.Disruptions of the respiratory system during sleep may include the conditions of sleep apnea or sleep hypopnea. Sleep apnea is a serious breathing disorder caused by airway obstruction, denoted obstructive sleep apnea, or derangement in central nervous system control of respiration, denoted central sleep apnea. Regardless of the type of apnea, people with sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes hundreds of times a night and sometimes for a minute or longer. Whereas sleep apnea refers to cessation of breathing, hypopnea is associated with periods of abnormally slow or shallow breathing. With each apnea or hypopnea event, the person generally briefly arouses to resume normal breathing. As a result, people with sleep apnea or hypopnea may experience sleep fragmented by frequent arousals.An adequate quality and quantity of sleep is required to maintain physiological homeostasis. Prolonged sleep deprivation or periods of highly fragmented sleep ultimately will have serious health consequences. Chronic lack of sleep may be associated with various cardiac or respiratory disorders affecting a patient's health and quality of life.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONEmbodiments of the present invention involve detecting disordered breathing, including apnea and hypopnea, using minute ventilation. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods for detecting disordered breathing implemented at least in part within a patient. Methods of the invention involve detecting a respiration pattern of a number of respiration cycles and determining breath intervals (BI) and tidal volume (TVOL) measurements of each of the respiration cycles. Methods of the invention further involve producing an unevenly sampled instantaneous minute ventilation (iMV) signal using the BI and TVOL measurements, and producing an evenly sampled iMV signal (resampled iMV signal) using the unevenly sampled iMV signal. Disordered breathing is detected based on a comparison between a baseline threshold and the resampled iMV signal.Other embodiments are directed to devices for detecting disordered breathing at least in part within a patient. Devices of the invention include an implantable housing and a sensor system disposed in the housing and configured to detect a respiration pattern of a number of respiration cycles. A processor is coupled to the sensor system. The processor is configured to execute program instructions to determine breath intervals (BI) and tidal volume (TVOL) measurements of each of the respiration cycles, produce an unevenly sampled instantaneous minute ventilation (iMV) signal using the BI and TVOL measurements, produce an evenly sampled iMV signal (resampled iMV signal) using the unevenly sampled iMV signal, and detect disordered breathing based on a comparison between a baseline threshold and the resampled iMV signal.According to other embodiments, devices for detecting disordered breathing are implemented at least in part within a patient and include a sensor configured to detect a respiration pattern of a number of respiration cycles and circuitry for determining breath intervals (BI) and tidal volume (TVOL) measurements of each of the respiration cycles. Devices of the invention further include means for producing an unevenly sampled instantaneous minute ventilation (iMV) signal using the BI and TVOL measurements, means for producing an evenly sampled iMV signal (resampled iMV signal) using the unevenly sampled iMV signal, and a detector configured to detect disordered breathing based on a comparison between a baseline threshold and the resampled iMV signal.Some embodiments involve determining if each respiration cycle meets predetermined quality criteria for calculating iMV, and producing, only for each respiration cycle that meets the predetermined quality criteria for purposes of detecting disordered breathing, an iMV signal and a resampled iMV signal. The predetermined quality criteria may include a breathing interval quality criterion based on the breathing interval of a current breath and the breathing interval of at least a previous breath, and the tidal volume of at least one previous breath. The baseline threshold is preferably calculated using only breaths that meet the predetermined quality criteria and disordered breathing is preferably detected using only breaths that meet the predetermined quality criteria.According to various embodiments, a respiration cycle quality check methodology of the present invention, such as a mid-term baseline (MTBL) approach discussed hereinbelow, may be used for implementing minute ventilation-based disordered breathing detection that does not utilize resampling of an iMV signal. For example, some embodiments involve determining if each respiration cycle meets predetermined quality criteria for calculating iMV and producing, only for each respiration cycle that meets the predetermined quality criteria for purposes of detecting disordered breathing, an iMV signal. Disordered breathing is detected based on a comparison between a baseline threshold and the iMV signal. The baseline threshold is preferably calculated using only breaths that meet the predetermined quality criteria and disordered breathing is preferably detected using only breaths that meet the predetermined quality criteria.Some embodiments involve computing an Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), which provides a measurement of apnea severity. According to such embodiments, a baseline average iMV value is computed using iMV values measured over a given time period. Periods of apnea and hypopnea are detected when the iMV value is less than the baseline for a pre-determined period of time. The number of detected apnea and hypopnea events are then summed together and divided by total sleep time to derive an AHI value.According to various embodiments, a methodology for computing a patient's AHI utilizes minute ventilation for purposes of performing respiration cycle quality check computations, such as those implemented by the MTBL approach discussed hereinbelow, and utilizes TVOL for disordered breathing detection, such as apnea/hypopnea detection.Moreover, a respiration cycle quality check methodology of the present invention may be implemented in a variety of respiratory diagnostics. For example, a respiration rate tracking diagnostic or other respiratory diagnostic may be implemented that utilizes a respiration cycle quality check approach of the present invention, such as the MTBL approach discussed hereinbelow. A respiration cycle quality check methodology of the present invention may be utilized alone or in combination with other advantageous features described herein.According to other embodiments, a resampling algorithm of the present invention may be implemented to process a wide variety of physiologic signals that are unevenly sampled or aperiodic in nature. Examples of such signals include electrocardiogram (ECG), electrogram (EGM), heart rate variability (HRV), transthoracic impedance, plural pressure, chest wall movement, diaphragm movement, heart rate, blood pressure, blood perfusion, blood gas concentration (e.g., O2 saturation), and nerve traffic indicative of another aperiodic physiologic parameter, among others. A resampling approach of the present invention may be implemented for processing a wide variety of aperiodic physiologic signals for a variety of applications, including monitoring, diagnostics, and therapy applications. A resampling algorithm of the present invention may be utilized alone or in combination with other advantageous features described herein.The above summary of the present invention is not intended to describe each embodiment or every implementation of the present invention.

It is to be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTSIn the following description of the illustrated embodiments, references are made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration, various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and structural and functional changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.A wide variety of medical devices may be configured to detect disordered breathing using a minute ventilation-based methodology in accordance with the present invention. Such devices may be configured with a variety of sensor arrangements for sensing patient respiration from which minute ventilation can be calculated, including respiration sensors, implantable intrathoracic respiration sensors, such as transvenous, endocardial, and/or epicardial sensors (i.e., intrathoracic electrodes), and/or subcutaneous, non-intrathoracic sensors, including can, header, and indifferent electrodes, and subcutaneous arrays or lead electrodes (i.e., non-intrathoracic electrodes).An adequate duration and quality of sleep is required to maintain physiological homeostasis. Prolonged sleep deprivation or periods of poor quality sleep ultimately will have serious health consequences. Disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea and hypopnea, is a major cause of interrupted sleep. People suffering from sleep apnea repeatedly stop breathing during sleep. Hypopnea is a related condition, characterized by periods of abnormally slow or shallow breathing.Sleep apnea/hypopnea may be obstructive, central, or a mixture of the two types. Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea is the most common type and is typically caused by a blockage of the airway, usually when the soft tissue in the throat collapses and closes during sleep. In central sleep apnea/hypopnea, the airway is not blocked but there is an interruption in signals from the brain controlling breathing. With each apnea/hypopnea event, the person may briefly arouse in order to resume breathing. The frequent interruptions during sleep result in extremely fragmented sleep of poor quality. Untreated, sleep apnea/hypopnea has a number of adverse health and quality of life consequences ranging from high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases to memory problems, headaches and degradation of social and work related activities.Diagnosis of the conditions causing sleep disturbances, including disordered breathing, may require people suffering from sleep disorders to spend one or more nights in a sleep laboratory. In the sleep laboratory setting, a patient can be instrumented for data acquisition and observed by trained personnel. Polysomnography may be used to diagnose and determine the severity of sleep apnea/hypopnea. During this procedure, a variety of physiological functions are externally detected and recorded during sleep, such as the electrical activity in the brain, eye movement, muscle activity, heart rate, respiratory effort, and blood oxygen levels. Manual evaluation of these physiological functions is performed by a technician and used to diagnose disordered breathing such as sleep apnea/hypopnea and assess possible therapeutic interventions.Testing in a sleep laboratory setting presents a number of obstacles in acquiring an accurate picture of a patient's typical sleep patterns. For example, spending a night in a laboratory typically causes a patient to experience a condition known as “first night syndrome,” involving disrupted sleep during the first few nights in an unfamiliar location. Furthermore, sleeping while instrumented and observed may not result in a realistic perspective of the patient's normal sleep patterns.Various embodiments of the invention involve detecting disordered breathing preferably based on sensed signals indicative of tidal volume (TVOL) and breath interval (BI). Sensed signals indicative of tidal volume and breath interval are preferably processed to produce a minute ventilation (MV) signal which has a unique character relative to a conventional MV signal and is used for disordered breathing detection. In some embodiments, an MV signal is used for the dual purpose of determining that the patient is asleep and detecting disordered breathing while the patient is asleep. In one approach, a conventional MV signal is used to determine that the patient is asleep, and a non-conventional MV signal produced in accordance with the present invention is used to detect disordered breathing. In another approach, a non-conventional MV signal produced in accordance with the present invention is used both to determine that the patient is asleep and to detect disordered breathing.In general, minute ventilation is computed as the product of TVOL and respiration rate. An MV signal in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is preferably generated using TVOL and BI signal information on a breath-to-breath basis. More particularly, and as shown in FIG. 1A, an instantaneous MV signal (iMV) 26 is generated using the product 24 of the instantaneous TVOL (iTVOL) 20 and the breath or respiratory interval, BI 22.The iMV signal 26 may be subject to processing by a resampling or interpolation algorithm 28 to produce a uniformly sampled iMV signal 30, referred to as a resampled or interpolated iMV signal 30.Respiratory signals, such as TVOL, MV, BI and iMV, are considered unevenly sampled signals. Sampling does not occur at a constant frequency or interval for these and other physiologic signals, such as ECG, EGM, HRV signals, for example. Rather, sampling occurs in concert with the physiological event or process from which the physiologic signal is derived (such events or processes being aperiodic). In the case of respiratory signals 12, an example of which is shown in FIG. 2A, sampling occurs whenever a breath occurs (i.e., the physiologic event/process in this case includes expiration and inspiration). A respiration rate associated with the respiratory signal 12 is, therefore, also non-periodic or unevenly sampled.Information about the original physiologic signal, such as a respiratory signal, is not lost when using a resampling method of the present invention. Once a uniformly sampled signal has been determined, it can be filtered with standard filtering techniques (e.g., IIR, FIR, etc). Without a constant sampling rate, filter coefficients cannot be determined. This resampling methodology is particularly well suited for apnea and hypopnea detection, and background averages can be calculated from the resampled signal.The respiration frequency is variable, especially during periods of apnea, and the “respiratory interval” cannot be computed until the next breath occurs. This presents a problem in the case of disordered breathing detection. For apnea detection, by way of example, a large single-point drop should result in the MV signal when an apnea event occurs, which corresponds to the patient's temporary cessation of breathing. However, conventional apnea detection approaches typically use large averaging windows to produce an MV signal, which reduces detection resolution of fast changes in patient breathing patterns, such as those associated with apnea and hypopnea events. Uniform sampling (interpolation) according to the present invention solves this problem by interpolating the breath-by-breath instantaneous MV into a consistently sampled signal.According to various non-limiting embodiments, uniformly sampled signed transthoracic impedance measurements are used to detect breaths. When the signal passes a predetermined negative level (hysteresis) and subsequently passes a predetermined positive level (hysteresis), a breath is declared detected on the subsequent zero cross. The time between zero crosses defines the breath interval (BI) and the difference between the maximal impedance and minimal impedance between these two zero crosses defines the tidal volume (TV). These breath intervals are non-uniform and the instantaneous minute ventilation (TV*60/BI) is based on non-uniform data. The resampling procedure according to embodiments of the present invention contemplates determining an instantaneous minute ventilation based on uniform intervals. It is understood that breath detection may be accomplished using a variety of techniques, such as detecting the positive zero crossing or detecting peaks, among others.An advantage of using a uniformly or constant sampled iMV signal concerns enabling filtering of non-uniformly sampled MV signals without resorting to large averaging windows. Another advantage concerns the ability to use any respiration signal or surrogate respiration signal (e.g., electrocardiogram, electrogram, pressure, heart rate variability). Use of a constant sampled iMV signal enables more accurate respiration diagnostics. For example, use of a constant sampled iMV signal produced in accordance with the present invention allows for more precise determination of minute ventilation without using the entire respiratory signal.Previous approaches for detecting disordered breathing have used the tidal volume amplitude to detect periods of apnea and hypopnea. Conventional tidal volume-based algorithms make gross assumptions about the sampling rate which are not always correct, especially during periods of apnea and hyperventilation. It has been found that use of a tidal volume signal, when used alone for purposes of disordered breathing detection, can lead to increased false detections, primarily due to the limited sensitivity and specificity of TVOL-only disordered breathing detection techniques and tidal volume-based signal detection techniques. The frequency of false detection of disordered breathing has been found to increase for mild forms of disordered breathing (i.e., border events), thereby resulting in reduced detection resolution.A disordered breathing detection approach of the present invention uses respiratory interval information (e.g., breath interval data) in combination with tidal volume data to generate instantaneous MV data and resampled iMV signals, which can provide for enhanced sensitivity and specificity for detecting disordered breathing, such as apnea and hypopnea, and discriminating between types of disordered breathing (e.g., apnea distinguished from hypopnea).An instantaneous MV signal and a resampled iMV signal produced and used in accordance with the present invention have been found to be more sensitive to periods of apnea than a TVOL signal, for example, due to decreased tidal volumes and lower respiratory rates associated with apnea. It is understood that decreased tidal volumes associated with apnea episodes results in TVOL signal amplitudes of reduced amplitude (e.g., reduced to near DC during cessation of breathing during an apnea event), which correspondingly reduces the sensitivity of an apnea or other disordered breathing detection scheme that relies solely on a TVOL signal. Hyperventilation that occurs after apnea, for example, results in increased tidal volumes and respiratory rates. Respiratory interval information of an instantaneous MV signal is used to compliment TVOL information of the MV signal to provide for enhanced resolution of hyperventilation detection and detection of transitions between apnea, hypopnea, hyperventilation, and normal breathing states.As is shown in FIG. 1B, the processes of FIG. 1A can be generalized and utilized for processing any aperiodic physiologic signal that is unevenly sampled. Such signals include ECG, EGM, HRV, transthoracic impedance, plural pressure, chest wall movement, diaphragm movement, heart rate, blood pressure, blood perfusion, blood gas concentration (e.g., O2 saturation), and nerve traffic indicative of another aperiodic physiologic parameter, among others. In FIG. 1B, one or more physiologic signals, SP(s), are acquired or received 40 and subject to a resampling/interpolation algorithm 42. This algorithm 42 produces constant sampled physiologic signals, SP(s) 44 (i.e., resampled SP(s)). One skilled in the art will readily appreciate the advantages of implementing a resampling approach of the present invention for processing a wide variety of aperiodic physiologic signals for a variety of applications, including monitoring, diagnostics, and therapy applications. It is noted that, in some approaches, averaging filters, which provide relatively consistent performance due to a constant sampling rate, may be used to produce a uniformly sampled iMV signal.According to various embodiments, an MV signal is processed in a manner that produces an instantaneous MV or iMV signal. FIGS. 2B-2D facilitate an understanding of an iMV signal generation approach in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A respiration waveform is shown in FIG. 2B, which evidences an apnea event. FIG. 2C shows markers that indicate both time and magnitude corresponding to detection of breaths (breath interval) and tidal volume based on the respiration waveform of FIG. 2B. FIG. 2D shows a plot of an instantaneous minute ventilation signal derived from the breath interval and tidal volume data shown in FIG. 2C.For each breath interval (I1-IN), iMV is calculated, such as by using the following algorithm:\\nWithin breath interval I1:\\nresampled iMV1=(resampling interval/I1)*TV(I1)*RR(I1)If a new breath I2 falls between resampling intervals:\\n        then use a weighted average\\nResampled iMV2=((I1-iMV-sample-timeprevious)/I1)*TV(I1)*RR(I1)+((I2-resampling interval)/I2)*TV(I2)*MV(I2)where, TV and RR are tidal volume and respiration rate, respectively. A resampling algorithm according to one implementation works by determining the percentage of the current interval covered by the new resampling frequency. If the resampling interval falls between two breath intervals, then the resampled value is calculated as a percentage of the first and the percentage of the second interval.The instantaneous iMV interval is preferably set by choosing the frequency of the resampled signal (e.g., for 2 Hz, a sample is calculated every 0.5 seconds). Within any breath interval, the resampled value is equal the number of seconds between re-sampling (e.g., 0.5 seconds) divided by the total length (in seconds) of the instantaneous signal multiplied by the instantaneous MV value. If the sample falls between two instantaneous values, the weighted average of both is used (e.g., a weighted average of the instantaneous MV signal). A graphical depiction of the algorithm discussed above for resampling iMV every 2 seconds is shown in FIG. 14.By way of further example, assume an MV signal is determined for each of a breath interval of 3 seconds, a next breath interval of 5 seconds, and following breath interval of 3.5 seconds. A resampling/interpolating algorithm of the present invention converts this non-uniform MV signal to a uniform MV signal that is consistently 0.5 seconds (for example) between samples, and helps smooth the transitions between each breath. This approach also solves the aforementioned conventional apnea detection problem where no breaths are present for 10 seconds, for example, so during the period of no breathing, the MV value using conventional approaches would slowly drift to zero.According to another non-limiting illustrative example, it is assumed that two breath intervals of 2 seconds and 4 seconds with TV's of 50 ml and 75 ml are found. The associated minute ventilation is 30*50 (1500 ml/minute) and 15*75 (1125 ml/minute). The minute ventilation may be resampled at uniform 3 second intervals, for example, using a weighted average, so at 3 seconds the minute ventilation is ⅔*1500+⅓*1125 and at 6 seconds the minute ventilation is ⅔*1125. The baseline values are then computed using these uniform instantaneous values, rather than non-uniform instantaneous values.In apnea detection approaches that utilize an iMV and/or resampled iMV signal produced in accordance with the present invention, as is illustrated in FIG. 2D, cessation of patient breathing is detected as a sudden drop in the iMV or resampled iMV signal magnitude, and resumption of patient breathing is detected as a sudden increase in the iMV or resampled iMV signal magnitude.FIG. 3 illustrates a display of various respiratory-related waveforms for a particular patient. In particular, the three display panels depict breath detection markers, an iMV signal developed in a manner discussed herein, and a resampled iMV signal also developed in a manner discussed herein.Disordered breathing detection according to embodiments of the present invention has been shown to be more impervious to noise from tidal volume fluctuations when compared to conventional approaches. In accordance with various embodiments, apnea, hypopnea, and other forms of disordered breathing are detected using an MV signal derived from signals produced by a transthoracic impedance sensor and processed in accordance with techniques of the present invention. In other embodiments, an MV signal derived from signals produced by an inter-thoracic pressure sensor may be processed in accordance with techniques of the present invention to detect apnea, hypopnea, and other forms of disordered breathing. In particular, apnea and hypopnea are detected using iMV values, such as iMV values derived from a resampled iMV signal.According to an exemplary embodiment, a baseline average iMV value is computed using iMV values measured over a given time period, such as approximately 120 seconds. Periods of apnea and hypopnea are detected when the iMV value (or a short-term average of the iMV value) is less than the baseline for a pre-determined period of time. The number of detected apnea and hypopnea events are then summed together and divided by total sleep time to derive an Apnea/Hypopnea Index, which provides a measurement of apnea severity.This process may be enhanced by using a resampled iMV values to establish a baseline average resampled iMV value, and detecting periods of apnea and hypopnea the resampled iMV value (or a short-term average of the resampled iMV value) is less than the baseline for a pre-determined period of time. It has been found that use of iMV signals and resampled iMV signals for disordered breathing detection in accordance with embodiments of the present invention provide for enhanced detection of disordered breathing events relative to conventional disordered breathing detection techniques.According some approaches, the MV signal is subject to a quality check to provide for enhanced detection of disordered breathing. A quality check is preferably performed for each detected breath, and only qualifying breaths are used for baseline calculations and apnea/hypopnea detection. It has been demonstrated that embodiments employing an MV signal quality check (which may be an optional feature) produce disordered breathing detection results that are nearly or substantially equivalent to detection results obtained using “gold standard” external sensing techniques in a sleep laboratory. When the MV signal quality check is not employed, disordered detection results are at least equivalent and generally better than those obtained using traditional approaches that solely use tidal volume, it being understood that use of an MV signal provides additional benefits, such as sensing patient sleep state, patient activity sensing for rate responsive pacing, among others.According to one approach, checking MV signal quality involves an average MV value which is computed using a short-term average MV signal value (e.g., sum of the tidal volumes within an 8 second block) and a long-term moving average MV signal value (e.g., based on a weighted average of the long-term moving average MV signal value and the new short-term average MV signal value). This average MV value is compared to a threshold, and if lower than the threshold, then the MV values are low, such that the respiratory sensing device cannot detect breaths properly and thus any calculation on breath tidal volume or interval detection will be erroneous. It is noted that this approach of determining short- and long-term moving average MV signal values for purposes of performing an MV signal quality check is based on an estimate of minute ventilation by summing a number of breaths over a predetermined block of time, while the disclosed approaches to determining iMV and resampled iMV values involve instantaneous multiplication of breath interval and tidal volume.Some embodiments of the invention involve determining that the patient is asleep, sensing tidal TVOL and BI signals indicative of disordered breathing, computing iMV, and detecting disordered breathing based on the computed iMV (or resampled iMV) relative to a baseline or threshold developed for the patient. Methods of sleep detection are described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,189,204 and 7,252,640, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.FIG. 4 is a graph of a transthoracic impedance signal 100 that is preferably used in connection with disordered breathing detection according to embodiments of the present invention. An implantable medical device of the present invention employs two or more impedance electrodes that are used to sense variations in a transthoracic impedance signal resulting from patient respiration. For example, the impedance signal 100 may be developed from an impedance sense electrode in combination with a cardiac rhythm management (CRM) device. The impedance voltage signal 100 shown in FIG. 4 is proportional to the transthoracic impedance, with the impedance increasing during respiratory inspiration and decreasing during respiratory expiration. The peak-to-peak transition of the impedance measurement is proportional to the amount of air inhaled in one breath, denoted the tidal volume, also illustrated in FIG. 4.The impedance of signal 100 increases 170 during any respiratory inspiration 120 and decreases 160 during any respiratory expiration 110. The impedance signal 100 is also proportional to the amount of air inhaled, denoted by a tidal volume 140, illustrated on the abscissa of the right side of the graph in FIG. 4. The variations in impedance during respiration, identifiable as the peak-to-peak variation of the impedance signal 100, may be used to determine the respiration tidal volume 140. Tidal volume 140 corresponds to the volume of air moved in a breath, one cycle of expiration 110 and inspiration 120. An instantaneous MV signal is generated using the product of the instantaneous TVOL and the breath interval derived from the impedance signal 100 as previously discussed. The iMV signal may be further processed to produce a resampled iMV signal, such as in the manner previously described and as shown in FIGS. 1A, 1F, and 3.Breathing disorders may be determined using an iMV signal or a resampled iMV signal produced from the impedance signal 100 or other physiologic signal that is modulated by patient respiration (i.e., a surrogate respiration signal). During non-REM sleep, a normal respiration pattern includes regular, rhythmic inspiration—expiration cycles without substantial interruptions. When the iMV signal or resampled iMV signal of the patient's respiration falls below a hypopnea threshold, then a hypopnea event is declared. If the patient's iMV signal or resampled iMV signal value minute ventilation falls further to an apnea threshold, e.g., about 10% of the recent average iMV signal or resampled iMV signal value minute ventilation or other baseline value, an apnea event is declared. FIG. 8, which is described in detail hereinbelow, illustrates processes according to embodiments of the present invention for detecting hypopnea and apnea events.FIG. 6 is a flow diagram showing various processes 501 for implantably computing iMV for purposes of detecting disordered breathing in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. According to FIG. 6, a patient's tidal volume (TVOL) is sensed 502 within the patient, preferably on a breath-by-breath basis. The patient's breath interval (BI) is sensed 504 within the patient, preferably on a breath-by-breath basis. The patient's instantaneous minute ventilation (iMV) is computed 506 using the sensed TVOL and BI signals. An MV baseline is preferably concurrently computed 508, which requires at least two breath intervals. Optionally, the iMV signal may then be interpolated to create a constant sample rate signal (i.e., resampled iMV signal). After the first MV baseline value is computed, the algorithm continues for subsequent breaths by comparing 510 the iMV signal or resampled iMV signal to a threshold baseline. Disordered breathing is detected 512 based on this comparison.FIG. 7 is a flow diagram showing various processes 601 for implantably computing instantaneous minute ventilation and validating same for purposes of detecting disordered breathing in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As is illustrated in FIG. 7, a patient's tidal volume and breath interval are sensed 602, 604 within the patient, preferably on a breath-by-breath basis. A quality check is made 606 for purposes of determining whether the current breath interval is valid. If the current breath interval is not valid, as is tested in block 608, the TVOL and BI data for the current breath are disregarded, and the logic returns to block 602. It is noted that the validation procedure shown in blocks 606-610 can be based on respiratory parameters other than breath interval, such as minute ventilation and tidal volume.If the current breath interval is valid, then the patient's iMV and/or resampled iMV is computed 612 using the current TVOL and BI signal data. An MV baseline is preferably concurrently computed 614, which requires at least two breath intervals. After the first MV baseline value is computed, the algorithm continues for subsequent breaths by comparing 616 iMV or resampled iMV to a threshold baseline. Disordered breathing is detected 618 based on this comparison.According to one approach, performing a quality check on a breath interval involves MV sensing circuitry determining if a current breath interval meets predetermined validity criteria. For example, false BI values may be returned during an MV settling time as a result of a noise transition or high voltage event. When a respiration is detected by the MV sensing circuitry, a message is sent to disordered breathing detection circuitry about the current breath interval. This message typically contains a list of parameters about the breath, including parameters indicating whether or not the current breath interval is valid. Only when a good or valid breath is detected by the MV sensing circuitry does the DB detection circuitry continue the baseline calculation and DB detection logic.For example, it has been observed in clinical trials that a minute ventilation sensor signal may occasionally be too small to detect accurately. Small amplitude MV sensor signals and missed breath detections may generate false positive apnea or hypopnea detections. To mitigate this issue, those periods of time in which MV sensor signal quality is low should be ignored in the analysis.According to some embodiments, an MV short-term average calculation may be employed that uses a 15/16 old+ 1/16 new IIR filter to generate a figure of merit. The figure of merit is calculated every 7.5 s and compared to a threshold. Below-threshold respiratory intervals are not counted towards usable analysis time and apnea or hypopnea detections are rejected. Above-threshold respiratory intervals are counted towards usable analysis time and apnea or hypopnea detections are included.In one approach, a mid-term baseline or MTBL calculation is made that is semi-empirical in its usage. It is formulated by using a “short-term average,” where 1/16 of the short-term average (a type of “MV”) is added to 15/16 of the previous MTBL every 7.5 seconds. This is an exponential type of filter where the MTBL would approach a step change in the short-term average after about 2*16*7.5 seconds. The level of the MTBL under which the determination of an apnea or hypopnea is equivocal can be determined empirically by comparing data from a scored sleep study to the measured MTBL. The level of MTBL is preferably chosen such that by discarding those episodes under this value, the correspondence of the remaining episodes between the sleep study data (i.e., “gold standard”) and the impedance based apnea-hypopnea determination is the greatest.FIG. 8 is a flow diagram showing various processes 701 for implantably computing a patient's resampled iMV for purposes of detecting disordered breathing in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As is shown in FIG. 8, a resampled iMV sample is received 702. A baseline value is calculated 704 based on the current resampled iMV sample and previous baseline sample(s). If the duration of the current resampled iMV sample is greater than a duration of the next breath, as is tested at block 706, the interval between the current and last breath is calculated 708.If, at block 706, the duration of the current resampled iMV sample is not greater than the duration of the next breath, then a check is made at block 710 to determine if the current resampled iMV sample is less than the hypopnea detection baseline threshold. If so, a check is made to determine 712 if a sleep disordered breathing (SDB) event is in progress. If an SDB event is not in progress, an SDB Event in Progress flag is set 718 to TRUE, and the logic returns to block 702. If an SDB event is in progress, a check is made 714 to determine if the breath interval is greater than a predetermined duration, such as 10 seconds. If so, then an Apnea Flag is set 716 to TRUE, otherwise the logic returns to block 702.If, at block 710, it is determined that the current resampled iMV sample is not less than the detection baseline threshold, then a check is made 720 to determine if an SDB event is in progress. If so, then the SDB Event in Progress Flag is set 722 to FALSE. A check is made to determine 724 if the time of the resampled iMV sample minus the previous breath is greater than 10 seconds OR if the breath interval is greater than 10 seconds. In block 724, if the resampled iMV sample falls below threshold, and then rises above threshold, it is necessary to determine if the intervals while the resampled iMV sample was below threshold were sufficiently long for an apnea event. Therefore, a check is made to determine if the length of time between breath intervals was >10 second, or if the time of the current resampled iMV sample and the previous breath was >10 seconds. If this is the case, then this event should be marked as an apnea. If so, the Apnea Flag is set 726 to TRUE and the logic proceeds to block 730, otherwise the logic skips block 726 and proceeds to block 730.At block 730, a check is made to determine if the Apnea Flag is set to TRUE. If so, an apnea event is declared 732, parameters are reset 734, and logic returns to block 702. If the Apnea Flag is not set to TRUE at block 730, a check is made to determine 740 if the time of the current resampled iMV sample minus the onset time is greater than 10 seconds. In this case, the Apnea Flag was not previously set. Since the resampled iMV sample was below threshold, and at no time was it more than 10 seconds between breaths, a check is made to determine if the time below threshold was >10 seconds. If so, a hypopnea event is declared 742, parameters are reset 744, and the logic returns to block 702. FIGS. 12 and 13 are graphical illustrations of hypopnea and apnea detection results produced by the detection processes depicted in FIG. 8.FIG. 9 is an illustration of a cardiac rhythm management system that implements disordered breathing diagnostics in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The system 800 shown in FIG. 9 may be configured to include circuitry and functionality for sleep disordered breathing detection in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In this illustrative example, disordered breathing diagnostic circuitry 835 is configured as a component of a pulse generator 805 of a cardiac rhythm management device 800. The implantable pulse generator 805 is electrically and physically coupled to an intracardiac lead system 810. The disordered breathing diagnostic circuitry 835 may alternatively be implemented in a variety of implantable monitoring, diagnostic, and/or therapeutic devices, such as an implantable cardiac monitoring device, an implantable drug delivery device, or an implantable neurostimulation device, for example.Portions of the intracardiac lead system 810 are shown inserted into the patient's heart 890. The intracardiac lead system 810 includes one or more electrodes configured to sense electrical cardiac activity of the heart, deliver electrical stimulation to the heart, sense the patient's transthoracic impedance, and/or sense other physiological parameters, e.g., cardiac chamber pressure or temperature. Portions of the housing 801 of the pulse generator 805 may optionally serve as a can electrode.Communications circuitry is disposed within the housing 801, facilitating communication between the pulse generator 805 including the disordered breathing diagnostic circuitry 835 and an external device, such as a disordered breathing therapy device, programmer, and/or an advanced patient management (APM) system. The communications circuitry can also facilitate unidirectional or bidirectional communication with one or more implanted, external, cutaneous, or subcutaneous physiologic or non-physiologic sensors, patient-input devices and/or information systems.The pulse generator 805 may optionally incorporate an electromyogram (EMG) sensor 820 disposed on the housing 801 of the pulse generator 805. The EMG sensor may be configured, for example, to sense myopotentials of the patient's skeletal muscle in the pectoral region. Myopotential sensing may be used in connection with sleep disorders associated with involuntary limb movement.The pulse generator 805 may further include a sensor configured to detect patient motion. The motion detector may be implemented as an accelerometer positioned in or on the housing 801 of the pulse generator 805. If the motion detector is implemented as an accelerometer, the motion detector may also provide acoustic information, e.g. rales, coughing, S1-S4 heart sounds, cardiac murmurs, and other acoustic information. The lead system 810 of the CRM device 800 may incorporate a transthoracic impedance sensor that may be used to acquire the patient's cardiac output, or other physiological conditions related to the patient's sleep disorder(s). The transthoracic impedance sensor may include, for example, one or more intracardiac electrodes 840, 842, 851-855, 863 positioned in one or more chambers of the heart 890. The intracardiac electrodes 841, 842, 851-855, 861, 863 may be coupled to impedance drive/sense circuitry 830 positioned within the housing of the pulse generator 805.The impedance signal may also be used to detect the patient's respiration waveform and/or other physiological changes that produce a change in impedance, including pulmonary edema, heart size, cardiac pump function, etc. The respiratory and/or pacemaker therapy may be altered on the basis of the patient's heart condition as sensed by impedance.In one example, the transthoracic impedance may be used to detect the patient's respiratory waveform, examples of which are shown in FIGS. 1-5. A voltage signal developed at the impedance sense electrode 852, illustrated in FIGS. 1-5, is proportional to the patient's transthoracic impedance and represents the patient's respiration waveform. The transthoracic impedance increases during respiratory inspiration and decreases during respiratory expiration. The transthoracic impedance may be used to determine the amount of air moved in one breath, denoted the tidal volume and/or the amount of air moved per minute, denoted the minute ventilation. A normal “at rest” respiration pattern, e.g., during non-REM sleep, includes regular, rhythmic inspiration expiration cycles without substantial interruptions, as indicated in FIG. 4.Returning to FIG. 9, the lead system 810 may include one or more cardiac pace/sense electrodes 851-855 positioned in, on, or about one or more heart chambers for sensing electrical signals from the patient's heart 890 and/or delivering pacing pulses to the heart 890. The intracardiac sense/pace electrodes 851-855, such as those illustrated in FIG. 9, may be used to sense and/or pace one or more chambers of the heart, including the left ventricle, the right ventricle, the left atrium and/or the right atrium. The lead system 810 may include one or more defibrillation electrodes 841, 842 for delivering defibrillation/cardioversion shocks to the heart.The pulse generator 805 may include circuitry for detecting cardiac arrhythmias and/or for controlling pacing or defibrillation therapy in the form of electrical stimulation pulses or shocks delivered to the heart through the lead system 810. Disordered breathing diagnostic circuitry 835 may be housed within the housing 801 of the pulse generator 805. The disordered breathing diagnostic circuitry 835 may be coupled to various sensors, including the transthoracic impedance sensor 830, EMG sensor 820, electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, cardiac electrogram sensors, nerve activity sensors, and/or other sensors capable of sensing physiological signals useful for disordered breathing detection.The disordered breathing diagnostic circuitry 835 may be coupled to a sleep disorder detector configured to detect sleep disorders such as disordered breathing, and/or movement disorders. An arousal detector and a sleep disorder detector may be coupled to a processor that may use information from the arousal detector and the sleep disorder detector to associate sleep disorder events with arousal events. The processor may trend the sleep disorder events and/or arousal events, associate the sleep disorder events with arousal events, and/or use the detection of the arousal events and/or the sleep disorder events for a variety of diagnostic purposes. The sleep disorder detector and/or the processor may also be configured as a component of the pulse generator 805 and may be positioned within the pulse generator housing 801. In one embodiment, information about the sleep disorder events and/or arousal events may be used to adjust therapy delivered by the CRM device 800 and/or other therapy device.For purposes of illustration, and not of limitation, various embodiments of devices implemented in accordance with the present invention are described herein may be implanted under the skin in the chest region of a patient. A patient implantable medical device (PIMD) that implements MV-based disordered breathing detection of the present invention may, for example, be implanted subcutaneously such that all or selected elements of the device are positioned on the patient's front, back, side, or other body locations suitable for sensing cardiac activity and/or delivering cardiac stimulation therapy. It is understood that elements of the PIMD may be located at several different body locations, such as in the chest, abdominal, or subclavian region with electrode elements respectively positioned at different regions near, around, in, or on the heart.The primary housing (e.g., the active or non-active can) of the PIMD, for example, may be configured for positioning outside of the rib cage at an intercostal or subcostal location, within the abdomen, or in the upper chest region (e.g., subclavian location, such as above the third rib). In one implementation, one or more leads incorporating electrodes may be located in direct contact with the heart, great vessel or coronary vasculature, such as via one or more leads implanted by use of conventional transvenous delivery approaches. In another implementation, one or more electrodes may be located on the primary housing and/or at other locations about, but not in direct contact with the heart, great vessel or coronary vasculature.In a further implementation, for example, one or more electrode subsystems or electrode arrays may be used to sense cardiac activity and deliver cardiac stimulation energy in a PIMD configuration employing an active can or a configuration employing a non-active can. Electrodes may be situated at anterior and/or posterior locations relative to the heart. Examples of useful electrode locations and features that may be employed in various embodiments of the present invention are described in commonly owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/465,520 filed Jun. 19, 2003, entitled “Methods and Systems Involving Subcutaneous Electrode Positioning Relative to a Heart,” and 10/738,608 filed Dec. 17, 2003, entitled “Noise Canceling Cardiac Electrodes,” which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.In one configuration, as is illustrated in FIG. 10, electrode subsystems of a PIMD system are arranged about a patient's heart 810. The PIMD system includes a first electrode subsystem, comprising a can electrode 802, and a second electrode subsystem 804 that includes at least two electrodes or at least one multi-element electrode. The second electrode subsystem 804 may include a number of electrodes used for sensing and/or electrical stimulation.In various configurations, the second electrode subsystem 804 may include a combination of electrodes. The combination of electrodes of the second electrode subsystem 804 may include coil electrodes, tip electrodes, ring electrodes, multi-element coils, spiral coils, spiral coils mounted on non-conductive backing, screen patch electrodes, and other electrode configurations as will be described below. A suitable non-conductive backing material is silicone rubber, for example.The can electrode 802 is positioned on the housing 801 that encloses the PIMD electronics. The PIMD system shown in FIG. 10 incorporates one or more sensors configured to sense respiration. A sensing element, e.g., electrode, used for respiration sensing may be disposed on housing 801, such that element 802 may be representative of such electrode(s) alone or in combination with a can electrode. Sensing elements used for respiration sensing may be disposed on another component of the PIMD system, such as on lead 806, a lead separate from lead 806, or on the subsystem element 804, which may be representative of such sensing element(s) alone or in combination with a cardiac electrode.A PIMD of the present invention may be implemented to communicate with a patient management server or network via an appropriate communications interface or an external programmer. A PIMD of the present invention may be used within the structure of an APM system. The advanced patient management system allows physicians to remotely and automatically monitor cardiac and respiratory functions, as well as other patient conditions.In one example, a PIMD implemented as a cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or resynchronization device may be equipped with various telecommunications and information technologies that enable real-time data collection, diagnosis, and treatment of the patient. Various PIMD embodiments described herein may be used in connection with advanced patient management. Methods, structures, and/or techniques described herein, which may be adapted to provide for remote patient/device monitoring, diagnosis, therapy, or other APM related methodologies, may incorporate features of one or more of the following references: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,221,011; 6,270,457; 6,277,072; 6,280,380; 6,312,378; 6,336,903; 6,358,203; 6,368,284; 6,398,728; and 6,440,066, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.The components, functionality, and structural configurations depicted herein are intended to provide an understanding of various features and combination of features that may be incorporated in a PIMD. It is understood that a wide variety of PIMDs and other implantable cardiac monitoring and/or stimulation device configurations are contemplated, ranging from relatively sophisticated to relatively simple designs. As such, particular PIMD or cardiac monitoring and/or stimulation device configurations may include particular features as described herein, while other such device configurations may exclude particular features described herein.FIG. 11 illustrates a block diagram of a system 900 suitable for implementing the methods of the invention as illustrated, for example, by the processes of FIGS. 6-8. In some embodiments, circuitry for detecting disordered breathing using an MV-based methodology is disposed within the housing of an implantable cardiac rhythm device 960. The cardiac rhythm device 960 includes a cardiac lead system 910 that is electrically coupled to the patient's heart. Electrical signals from the patient's heart are sensed via the lead system 910 by cardiac sensing circuitry 925. The cardiac therapy control circuitry 954 may detect arrhythmic conditions, such as bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia, based on the sensed cardiac electrical signals. Cardiac therapy control circuitry 954 controls cardiac therapy circuitry 915 which generates electrical stimulation pulses delivered to the heart via the lead system 910 to treat various heart rhythm irregularities. For example, the cardiac therapy circuitry 914 may generate a series of low energy electrical pacing pulses timed to assist the heart in maintaining a hemodynamically appropriate rhythm. The cardiac therapy circuitry 914 may generate high energy shocks delivered to the heart if the cardiac control circuitry 954 detects tachycardia or fibrillation, arrhythmic conditions producing a heart rate that is too fast and possibly lethal.The system 900 includes a sensor 922 for sensing patient respiration. The sensor may be configured, for example, as intracardiac electrodes used to develop a transthoracic impedance signal which tracks respiration. Respiration sensor drive circuitry 924 provides the necessary drive signals to activate the drive electrodes 922. Response signals are sensed via sense electrodes 922 and are conditioned by the respiration sense circuitry 924.The respiration drive/sense circuitry 924 generates a respiration signal that is received by the respiration characteristic measurement circuitry 921. The measurement circuitry 921 measures one or more characteristics of the respiration signal. In various embodiments, the characteristic measured may comprise, for example, breath rate, breath interval, tidal volume, or other respiration characteristics. A respiration characteristic may be measured for each breath cycle, e.g., breath rate per cycle or breath interval duration per cycle, or multiple breath cycles may be used in the respiration characteristic measurement, e.g., average tidal volume for X number of breath cycles.The measurement circuitry 921 may pre-process the respiration signal received from the respiration drive/sense circuitry 924 to remove spurious breath detections. In one scenario, the cardiac therapy control processor 954 provides R-R interval information to the measurement circuitry 921. The measurement circuitry 921 compares breath intervals to filtered R-R interval estimates to identify and remove erroneous breath detections that are due to cardiac activity.A respiration processor 920 receives the measurements and uses the measurements to compute iMV and/or resampled iMV via processing unit 926 and in a manner discussed hereinabove. A quality check of the breath interval or iMV value is made by the quality check circuitry 923. For example, in one implementation, the measurement circuitry 921 measures TVOL and BI for each breath cycle. The respiration processor 920 and processing unit 926 cooperate to generate iMV and/or resampled iMV and detect disordered breathing using iMV/resampled iMV values relative to a baseline threshold. This data and trending data produced by unit 955 may be stored in memory 945, and/or may be transmitted via communications circuitry 935 to a remote device 965.A system according to the present invention may include one or more of the features, structures, methods, or combinations thereof described herein. For example, a cardiac monitor, cardiac stimulator, drug pump, neurological monitor and/or therapy device, respiration monitor and/or therapy device, or other type of implantable, partially implantable or patient-external medical device may be implemented to include one or more of the advantageous features and/or processes described above. It is intended that such an implanted, partially implanted or patient external device need not include all of the features described herein, but may be implemented to include selected features that provide for useful structures and/or functionality. Such a device may be implemented to provide a variety of therapeutic or diagnostic functions.The implementation described in connection with FIG. 11 presumes that measurement of respiration characteristics, estimation of respiration characteristics, determination of respiration metrics and developing respiration trends is performed within an implantable device. In other configurations, some or all of these processes may be performed by the remote device 965, which may comprise a patient-external device, or by two or more implantable or patient-external devices that are communicatively coupled. For example, in one configuration, the implantable device 960 may perform one subset of the functions described above and the remote device 965, which may be a device programmer or an advanced patient management system, may perform another subset of the functions. The remote device 965 typically includes a display for displaying respiration, disordered breathing, and other patient information (e.g., text and graphics).Various modifications and additions can be made to the preferred embodiments discussed hereinabove without departing from the scope of the present invention.

Particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to variable geometry turbochargers.Turbochargers are well known devices for supplying air to the intake of an internal combustion engine at pressures above atmospheric pressure (boost pressures). A conventional turbocharger essentially comprises an exhaust gas driven turbine wheel mounted on a rotatable shaft within a turbine housing connected downstream of an engine outlet manifold. Rotation of the turbine wheel rotates a compressor wheel mounted on the other end of the shaft within a compressor housing. The compressor wheel delivers compressed air to the engine intake manifold. The turbocharger shaft is conventionally supported by journal and thrust bearings, including appropriate lubricating systems, located within a central bearing housing connected between the turbine and compressor wheel housings.In known turbochargers, the turbine stage comprises a turbine chamber within which the turbine wheel is mounted; an annular inlet passageway defined between facing radial walls arranged around the turbine chamber; an inlet arranged around the inlet passageway; and an outlet passageway extending from the turbine chamber. The passageways and chambers communicate such that pressurised exhaust gas admitted to the inlet chamber flows through the inlet passageway to the outlet passageway via the turbine and rotates the turbine wheel. It is also known to improve turbine performance by providing vanes, referred to as nozzle vanes, in the inlet passageway so as to deflect gas flowing through the inlet passageway towards the direction of rotation of the turbine wheel.Turbines may be of a fixed or variable geometry type. Variable geometry turbines differ from fixed geometry turbines in that the size of the inlet passageway can be varied to optimise gas flow velocities over a range of mass flow rates so that the power output of the turbine can be varied to suite varying engine demands. For instance, when the volume of exhaust gas being delivered to the turbine is relatively low, the velocity of the gas reaching the turbine wheel is maintained at a level which ensures efficient turbine operation by reducing the size of the annular inlet passageway. Turbochargers provided with a variable geometry turbine are referred to as variable geometry turbochargers.In one known type of variable geometry turbine an axially moveable wall member, generally referred to as a “nozzle ring” defines one wall of the inlet passageway. The position of the nozzle ring relative to a facing wall of the inlet passageway is adjustable to control the axial width of the inlet passageway. Thus, for example, as gas flow through the turbine decreases, the inlet passageway width may be decreased to maintain gas velocity and optimise turbine output. The nozzle ring is provided with vanes which extend into the inlet and through slots provided in a “shroud” defining the facing wall of the inlet passageway to accommodate movement of the nozzle ring. The vanes are at a fixed angle relative to the radius of the nozzle ring. A variable geometry turbocharger including such a variable geometry turbine is for instance disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,552.An object of the present invention is provide a novel variable geometry turbine structure.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a variable geometry turbine comprising:a turbine wheel supported in a housing for rotation about a turbine axis;the housing defining an annular inlet passage disposed around an inducer portion of the turbine wheel and an outlet passage including a tubular wall disposed around an exducer portion of the turbine wheel;the inlet passage being defined between first and second radial inlet surfaces, one of said first and second inlet surfaces being defined by a moveable wall member and the other of said first and second inlet surfaces being defined by a facing wall of said housing, the moveable wall member being moveable relative to the facing wall of the housing along the turbine axis to vary the size of the inlet passageway;the moveable wall member being displaceably mounted within an annular cavity defined between said tubular wall and a surrounding wall of the housing.In the known turbocharger mentioned above, the moveable wall member of the variable geometry turbine is mounted in an annular chamber defined by the bearing housing. Mounting the moveable wall member in an annular cavity defined on the exducer side of the inlet passageway avoids the need for a specially designed bearing housing to accommodate the moveable wall member and actuator mechanism. This may be useful for instance to enable a standardised bearing housing to be used for both fixed geometry and variable geometry turbines. The present invention also enables the size of the bearing housing to be reduced as compared with a bearing housing which must accommodate a variable geometry mechanism, which may also be advantageous in some applications.As the turbine wheel rotates, it sweeps out a tubular surface known as the profile of the wheel. In many applications it is preferable for the exducer portion of the turbine wheel to sweep out a tubular profile which varies in radius along the axis of the turbine—typically reducing in radius in a direction away from the inducer portion of the turbine wheel. Such a turbine wheel profile is known to improve efficiency. The radius may reduce gradually so that the profile is curved. In accordance with the present invention the inner tubular surface defined by the tubular wall may be profiled to match (or at least substantially match, for example approximate to) the profile of the exducer portion of the turbine wheel. This allows the wheel to have an efficient profile whilst also avoiding an undesirably large gap between the exducer portion of the turbine wheel and the tubular wall which may reduce efficiency.The surrounding wall (which surrounds the tubular wall) may extend axially beyond the tubular wall to define a generally tubular portion of the outlet passage downstream of the tubular wall relative to flow through the turbine.In some embodiments, the housing comprises an inlet portion defining said inlet passage and at least a portion of the surrounding wall and an outlet portion joined to said inlet portion and defining at least a portion of said outlet passage. The outlet portion of the housing may also define at least a portion of the surrounding wall. The tubular wall may be supported by the outlet portion of the housing. This would for instance allow use of a common inlet housing portion for turbine wheels having different exducer profiles, the differing profiles being accommodated by attachment of a suitably configured outlet housing portion. The tubular wall may for instance be integrally formed with the outlet portion of the housing. For example a generally radially extending annular wall portion integral with the tubular wall and said outlet portion of the housing may extend between the two and close an axial end of the cavity remote from the inlet passage.In some embodiments the tubular wall may be defined by a tubular wall member supported within said surrounding wall by at least one radial projection extending from said tubular wall member to said surrounding wall. The radial projection (which may for instance be a radially extending annular flange) may for example be secured (e.g. clamped) between the inlet and outlet portions of the housing. The radial projection (e.g. radially extending annular flange) may be integral with said tubular member. Turbine wheels having differing exducer profiles could therefore be accommodated by fitting an appropriately configured tubular wall member into a turbine housing without necessarily having to change any other details of the housing.In some embodiments the moveable wall member is mounted on an end of at least one axially moveable rod, the or each rod extending through an aperture in said annular wall portion extending between the tubular wall and the surrounding wall, or radial projection providing support for a tubular wall member, for connection to an actuating mechanism. The moveable wall member may for instance be mounted on two of such axially moveable rods, and the turbine may further comprise an actuating mechanism including a beam linked to each of the rods and means for displacing the beam in a direction along the axis of the turbine to thereby axially displace the moveable wall member. The beam may for instance be disposed within the outlet passage downstream of the tubular wall and be connected to an actuator disposed outside of the outlet passage by a linkage which extends through a wall of the outlet passage. In one embodiment the outlet passage comprises a first generally tubular portion extending axially away from the tubular wall, and a second portion extending at an oblique angle to the first portion and defined at least in part by the wall of the outlet passage through which the linkage extends.The linkage may comprise a drive rod. The drive rod may be integrally formed with the beam.In one alternative embodiment, the moveable wall member is mounted on an end of at least one axially moveable rod, the or each rod extending through an aperture in a radially extending support wall (e.g. an annular flange) which extends between the tubular wall and the surrounding wall (the radially extending support wall being located between, for example, the inlet passage and said annular wall portion or radial projection). An actuating mechanism engages the or each rod on the opposite side of the support wall to the moveable wall member. The actuating mechanism may for instance be of the general type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,522 mentioned above and may comprise a yoke pivotally supported relative to the housing and defining at least one arm which extends into engagement with the or each rod. The arm or arms of the yoke may extend through the surrounding wall of the housing.In embodiments in which the moveable wall member is mounted on such rods, the rods may be connected to the wall member by any suitable method which preferably allows for expansion of the nozzle ring. For instance, known methods of connecting support rods to moveable wall members of known variable geometry turbines, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,522 referred to above, may be utilised. Other possibilities will be known to the appropriately skilled person.Various different forms of actuator could be used to provide a driving force for movement of the moveable wall member. Possible actuators include, but are not limited, to pneumatic, hydraulic and electric actuators.An annular array of inlet vanes may be fixed to, and extend from, the first inlet surface, and vane slots may be provided in the second inlet surface to receive the inlet vanes as the inlet surfaces move (axially, for example) towards one another. For instance, in some embodiments the moveable wall member defines a first surface supporting an annular array of vanes which extend through a slotted facing wall of the housing, and possibly into an annular cavity defined behind said facing wall of the housing. Alternatively, the vanes may extend from the fixed wall of the housing and extend through slots provided in the moveable wall member as the moveable wall member moves towards the fixed wall of the housing.In some embodiments, the moveable wall member may comprise a radial wall defining said inlet surface and two axially extending annular flanges which extend into said cavity from radially opposite edges of the radial wall. An annular seal may be provided between either a flange and the cavity to prevent gas flow through the cavity.In embodiments in which inlet vanes are fixed to the first inlet surface, and the second inlet surface is defined by the moveable wall member and provided with slots to receive said vanes, the moveable wall member may define an internal annular chamber which receives said vanes.In alternative embodiments the moveable wall member may comprise a radially extending annular wall defining said inlet surface, and an axially extending tubular wall which is slidably received within said cavity.The turbine housing may be connected to a bearing housing defining a bearing cavity, the turbine wheel being mounted on a turbine shaft which extends through a housing wall separating the turbine wheel and bearing cavity.According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a turbocharger comprising a variable geometry turbine according to the first aspect of the present invention. The turbine of the turbocharger may have, for example, one or more of the features described above in relation to the turbine of the first aspect of the present invention.Specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompany drawings, in which:FIG. 1 is an axial cross-section through a known variable geometry turbocharger;FIG. 2 shows a diagrammatic axial cross-section through a variable geometry turbine in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention;FIG. 3 shows a diagrammatic and cross section through an inlet portion of a turbine section of a variable geometry turbine in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention; andFIGS. 4 to 8 show axial cross-sectional views of the variable geometry turbines in accordance with the further embodiments of present invention.Referring to FIG. 1, this illustrates a known variable geometry turbocharger comprising a variable geometry turbine housing 1 and a compressor housing 2 interconnected by a central bearing housing 3. A turbocharger shaft 4 extends from the turbine housing 1 to the compressor housing 2 through the bearing housing 3. A turbine wheel 5 is mounted on one end of the shaft 4 for rotation within the turbine housing 1, and a compressor wheel 6 is mounted on the other end of the shaft 4 for rotation within the compressor housing 2. The shaft 4 rotates about turbocharger axis V-V on bearing assemblies located in the bearing housing 3.The turbine housing 1 defines an inlet volute 7 to which gas from an internal combustion engine (not shown) is delivered. The exhaust gas flows from the inlet chamber 7 to an axial outlet passageway 8 via an annular inlet passageway 9 and turbine wheel 5. The inlet passageway 9 is defined on one side by the face 10 of a radial wall of a movable annular wall member 11, commonly referred to as a “nozzle ring”, and on the opposite side by an annular shroud 12 which forms the wall of the inlet passageway 9 facing the nozzle ring 11. The shroud 12 covers the opening of an annular recess 13 in the turbine housing 1.The nozzle ring 11 supports an array of circumferentially and equally spaced inlet vanes 14 each of which extends across the inlet passageway 9. The vanes 14 are orientated to deflect gas flowing through the inlet passageway 9 towards the direction of rotation of the turbine wheel 5. When the nozzle ring 11 is proximate to the annular shroud 12, the vanes 14 project through suitably configured slots in the shroud 12, into the recess 13.The position of the nozzle ring 11 is controlled by an actuator assembly of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,552 referred to above (and which is incorporated herein by reference). An actuator (not shown) is operable to adjust the position of the nozzle ring 11 via an actuator output shaft (not shown), which is linked to a yoke 15. The yoke 15 in turn engages axially extending rods 16 that support the nozzle ring 11. Accordingly, by appropriate control of the actuator (which may for instance be pneumatic or electric), the axial position of the rods 16 and thus of the nozzle ring 11 can be controlled.The nozzle ring 11 has axially extending radially inner and outer annular flanges 17 and 18 that extend into an annular cavity 19 provided in the turbine housing 1. Inner and outer sealing rings 20 and 21 are provided to seal the nozzle ring 11 with respect to inner and outer annular surfaces of the annular cavity 19 respectively, whilst allowing the nozzle ring 11 to slide within the annular cavity 19. The inner sealing ring 20 is supported within an annular groove formed in the radially inner annular surface of the cavity 19 and bears against the inner annular flange 17 of the nozzle ring 11. The outer sealing ring 20 is supported within an annular groove formed in the radially outer annular surface of the cavity 19 and bears against the outer annular flange 18 of the nozzle ring 11.Gas flowing from the inlet chamber 7 to the outlet passageway 8 passes over the turbine wheel 5 and as a result torque is applied to the shaft 4 to drive the compressor wheel 6. Rotation of the compressor wheel 6 within the compressor housing 2 pressurises ambient air present in an air inlet 22 and delivers the pressurised air to an air outlet volute 23 from which it is fed to an internal combustion engine (not shown). The speed of the turbine wheel 5 is dependent upon the velocity of the gas passing through the annular inlet passageway 9. For a fixed rate of mass of gas flowing into the inlet passageway, the gas velocity is a function of the width of the inlet passageway 9, the width being adjustable by controlling the axial position of the nozzle ring 11. FIG. 1 shows the annular inlet passageway 9 fully open. The inlet passageway 9 may be closed to a minimum by moving the face 10 of the nozzle ring 11 towards the shroud 12.With the prior art turbocharger described above, the movable inlet wall (nozzle ring 11) is mounted within a cavity defined by the bearing housing. In contrast, the present invention provides a variable geometry turbine including a movable inlet wall member which is displacably mounted within a cavity defined in the turbine housing. The present invention is suitable for, but not limited to, a turbocharger. However, since the invention relates only to the nature of the turbine, other details of a turbocharger incorporating the present invention, such as the bearing housing and compressor details will not be described.Referring first to FIG. 2, this schematically illustrates part of a turbine housing 30 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. It will be understood that the turbine housing is generally symmetric about a turbine axis. The turbine housing, indicated generally by reference 30 comprises an inlet portion 31 and an outlet portion 32. The inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing is connected to an appropriate bearing housing 33 via an annular “V-band” 34. Details of the bearing housing may be entirely conventional (for instance they correspond to those of a known fixed geometry turbocharger bearing housing) and are therefore not shown and will not be described. It is to be understood, however, that the bearing housing will include bearing assemblies for rotational support of the turbine shaft, and oil delivery passages for provision of lubricant to the bearings.The inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing 30 defines an inlet volute 35 which leads to annular inlet passage 36 which surrounds an inducer portion 37 of a turbine wheel 38 rotatably mounted within the turbine housing 30. The outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing 30 is generally tubular and is connected to the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing 30 by an annular V-band (not shown) where the two housings meet at location 30a. The outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing includes an inner tubular wall 32a which extends to the annular inlet passage 36 and surrounds an exducer portion 39 of the turbine wheel 38. An annular cavity 40 is defined between the tubular wall 32a and a surrounding wall of the housing defined in part by a wall 41 of the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing and a wall 42 defined by the outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing. The cavity 40 is closed at one end by a generally radially extending wall portion 43 which integrally connects the tubular wall 32a to the outer wall 43 of the outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing. The opposite end of the cavity 40 is however open and slidably receives a movable nozzle ring 44.The movable nozzle ring 44 is generally L-shaped in cross-section having a tubular portion 44a which extends into the cavity 40, and a radially extending inlet wall portion 44b which defines a movable wall surface of the inlet passageway 36. An annular array of inlet vanes 45 extend from the nozzle ring wall 44b across the inlet passage 36. The bearing housing 33 is provided with an annular cavity 46 to receive the nozzle ring vanes 45 and thereby accommodate movement of the nozzle ring 44. The cavity 46 is covered by an annular shroud plate 47 which defines vane slots (not shown) into which respective vanes 46 extend.The nozzle ring 44 is supported on a pair of diametrically opposed support rods 48 (only one of which is visible in FIG. 2) which extend parallel to the turbine axis and are slidably supported within respective guide bushes 49 which are located in apertures provided in a radially extending support wall 50. In the illustrated embodiment the support wall 50 is an annular member which is clamped between the inlet portion 31 and outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing and which extends to the tubular wall 32a. The nozzle ring 44 is sealed with respect to the cavity 40 by an annular seal member 51 disposed between the tubular portion 44a of the nozzle ring and the wall 41 of the inlet portion 31 of the housing. The nozzle ring 44 may for instance be supported on the rods 48 in substantially the same articulated manner as shown in FIG. 1 or disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,552.The nozzle ring 44 may be displaced along the axis of the turbine to vary the width of the inlet 36 by an appropriate actuating mechanism (not shown) coupled to the support rods 48. The skilled person will appreciate that a variety of different forms of actuating mechanism could be employed to control movement of the nozzle ring via the support rods 48. For instance an actuator mechanism substantially as illustrated in FIG. 1 above or disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,552 referenced above, may be used. As such, ends of the arms of a yoke (not shown) located in the cavity 40 could be connected to respective support rods 48. The yoke could for instance be operated by a shaft passing through the wall 32 of the turbine housing.It will be appreciated that with the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 2, the provision of the movable nozzle ring within the turbine housing simplifies the structure of the bearing housing. In particular, the details of the nozzle ring and turbine housing can be changed without necessarily needing to the change the bearing housing. For instance, with the present invention the tubular wall 32a which surrounds the exducer portion 39 of the turbine wheel may be profiled (as illustrated) to conform to the profile of the exducer portion turbine wheel. This both permits use of a ‘profiled’ turbine wheel and also ensures that the exducer portion 39 of the turbine wheel 38 sweeps closely across the surface of the housing as it rotates about the turbine axis, with the minimum gap there between which maximises efficiency.Different turbine wheel profiles can thus be accommodated simply by modifying the turbine housing 30, and in particular by changing only the configuration of the tubular wall 37 of the outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing, without the need to modify the bearing housing or indeed the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing.A second embodiment of the invention will now be described within reference to FIG. 3. Whereas with the embodiment of FIG. 2 the inner tubular wall 32a which defines the nozzle ring cavity 43 is formed integrally with the outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing (and may for instance be cast as a single component), with the embodiment of FIG. 3 an inner tubular wall is provided by a separate component as will be described.As with the embodiment of FIG. 2, the turbine housing 60 comprises an inlet portion 61 and an outlet portion 62. The inlet portion 61 of the turbine housing is substantially the same as the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing 30 of FIG. 2 and defines and inlet volute 63 which leads to an annular inlet passage 64 which surrounds and inducer portion 37 of a turbine wheel 38. The inlet portion 61 of the turbine housing 60 is joined to a bearing housing 65 by a V-band 66. Once again, details of the bearing housing 65 are not shown and may be entirely conventional. Similarly, the outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing 60 is connected to the inlet portion 61 via a V-band (not shown) in the region of abutment 60a. The outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing comprises a generally tubular portion 67 extending axially away from the turbine wheel which leads to a generally laterally extending portion 68 which is defined in part by a wall 62a of the outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing.An inner tubular wall member 69 is supported within the turbine housing and comprises a tubular portion which forms a tubular wall 69a extending to the inlet passage 64 and surrounding an exducer portion 39 of the turbine wheel 38, and a radially extending annular wall or flange 69b which is clamped between the inlet portion 61 and outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing 60 to support the tubular wall member 69 in position. An annular nozzle ring cavity 70 is defined between the tubular wall 69a and a surrounding wall 71 of the inlet portion 61 of the turbine housing. A movable nozzle ring 72 is slidably mounted within the nozzle ring cavity 70 and sealed within respect thereto by annular seal members 73 and 74. The nozzle ring has substantially the same structure as that shown above in FIG. 1 and comprises a radially extending face 72a which defines one wall of the inlet passageway 64, and axially extending inner and outer annular flanges 72b and 72c respectively. An annular array of inlet vanes 75 are supported on the face 72a of the nozzle ring and extend across the inlet passageway 64 and into an annular cavity 76 provided by the bearing housing 65 and covered by an annular shroud plate 77 which is provided with respective vane slots (not shown) to receive the vanes 75.In common with the first embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 2, the nozzle ring 72a is supported on a pair of diametrically opposed support rods 78 which again may for instance be coupled to the nozzle ring in an articulated manner as shown in FIG. 1 or described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,552. The support rods 78 are slidably mounted within bushes 79 which are supported within respective apertures provided within the radially extending flange 69b of the tubular wall member 69. In this particular illustrated embodiment of the invention the movement of the nozzle ring 72 is controlled by an actuating mechanism comprising a beam 80 which is linked to the ends of each of the support rods 78. The connection to the rods 78 may be rigid, or may allow some relative movement (for instance a radially slidable connection) to accommodate thermal expansion. The beam 80 is defined on the end of a rod 81 which extends through an aperture 82 provided in the wall 62b of the outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing, within a bush 83, and which links the beam 80 to appropriate actuator (not shown) such as for instance a conventional pneumatic, or hydraulic or electric actuator. The beam 80 is profiled such that it does not provide any significant obstruction to the flow of exhaust gas to the outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing 60. The support rods 78 and bushes 83 provide bearing surfaces which not only provide for axial movement of the nozzle ring, but also react to torque forces generated on the nozzle ring as gas flows through the turbine.As with the embodiment of FIG. 2, the tubular wall 69a of the tubular wall member 60 is profiled to match the profile of the exducer portion 39 of the turbine wheel 38 in order to maximise efficiency. With the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 3, different profile turbine wheels can readily be accommodated by appropriate selection of a tubular wall member 69 without necessitating any change to the structure of the inlet portion 61 or outlet portion 62 of the turbine housing 60, or to the nozzle ring and its actuating mechanism.It will be appreciated that various details of the embodiments of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 can be modified without departing from the invention. For instance, the nozzle ring structure of FIG. 2 could be incorporated in the embodiment of the invention of FIG. 3 and vice versa. Similarly, the actuating mechanism illustrated in FIG. 3 could be applied to the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 2 by extending the support rods 48 through the radial wall 43 which connects the tubular wall 37 and surrounding wall of the outlet portion 32 of the turbine housing 30. Similarly, actuating mechanisms other than that shown in FIG. 3 can be incorporated in embodiments of the invention comprising a removable tubular wall member 69, such as for instance an actuating mechanism similar to that shown in FIG. 1 and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,552.Whereas with the embodiments of FIGS. 2 and 3, the inlet vanes are supported on a movable nozzle ring, in alternative embodiments of the invention the inlet vanes may be fixed to a wall of the turbine housing, or bearing housing, and extend through vane slots provided in a moveable inlet wall member. Examples of such embodiments of the invention are schematically illustrated in FIGS. 4 to 6.Referring first to FIG. 4, and where appropriate using the same reference numerals as used in FIG. 3, inlet vanes 90 are supported on a fixed nozzle ring 91 which is mounted within an annular recess 92 defined by a wall of the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing 33. The vanes 90 extend across the turbine inlet 36 and through vane slots (not visible in FIG. 4) provided within a radial face 93 of a movable wall member 94 which otherwise may have substantially the same configuration as the nozzle ring 72 shown in FIG. 3 (it is for instance sealed with respect to the cavity 70 by annular seals 73 and 74). A heat shield 114 is located between the bearing housing and the turbine wheel 38 and has a radially extending flange which is clamped between the bearing housing 33 and turbine housing 31 to hold the heat shield in position. Other details of the turbine structure may be as described above. In an alternative embodiment the nozzle ring may be supported by a suitable configured portion of a modified bearing housing.Referring now to FIG. 5, and where appropriate using the same reference numerals as used in FIG. 4, this schematically illustrates a modification of the structure shown in FIG. 4 in which the movable wall member 100 has a “box-sectioned” configuration defining an internal vane cavity 101 to receive the fixed inlet vanes 90 as the nozzle ring is moved to vary the width of the inlet passage 36. In this embodiment a single annular seal member 73 is required to seal the movable wall member 100 with respect to the cavity 70.FIG. 6 illustrates a modification of the embodiment of FIG. 5 and the same reference numerals are used where appropriate. In FIG. 6, the turbine housing 31 is secured to the bearing housing 33 by clamping bolts 115 which pass through a clamping ring 116 which bridges an annular join between the bearing housing 33 and turbine housing 31. A modification of this arrangement in which the nozzle ring 92 is supported in an annular recess provided by the bearing housing rather than the turbine housing is shown in FIG. 7. In this embodiment the heat shield 114 is clamped between the fixed nozzle ring 92 and the bearing housing 33. The heat shield 92 has an annular recess to accommodate the circumferential edge of the heat shield 114. Other details of the bearing and turbine housing, including their manner of connection, are similar to those shown in FIG. 6.Turning now to FIG. 6, and where appropriate using the same reference numerals as used in FIG. 5, this schematically illustrates a modification of the turbine housing structure shown in FIG. 5 in which the inlet vanes 90 extend from a modified nozzle ring 110. The nozzle ring 110 comprises a generally cylindrical portion 110a which surrounds a generally cylindrical portion 33a of the bearing housing 33, and a radially extending annular wall portion 110b which defines one radial wall of the inlet 36 and supports the nozzle vanes 90. The generally cylindrical portion 110a of the nozzle ring 110 includes a radially extending annular flange 111 which abuts against an annular flange provided by the bearing housing 33 and is clamped thereto by a v-band 34. A heat shield 114 is also clamped between the bearing housing 33 and nozzle ring 110. The radially extending wall 110b of the nozzle ring 110 mates with an annular portion of the turbine housing 31 and is clamped thereto by a clamping ring 112 secured to the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing via bolts 113 (only one of which is shown in FIG. 6). With this arrangement the fixed nozzle ring 110 effectively provides a mechanism for joining the inlet portion 31 of the turbine housing to the bearing housing 33.The movable wall members of the embodiments of FIGS. 4 to 6 (which may be configured as movable shroud members) can be coupled to the end of the respective support rods in substantially the same way as the moveable nozzle rings of the embodiments of FIGS. 2 and 3.Whereas an articulated connection between the support rods and the moveable wall members (either the moveable nozzle rings of FIGS. 2 and 3 or the moveable shroud members of FIGS. 4 to 6) is advantageous in accommodating thermal expansion of the moveable wall member without distortion, in other embodiments of the invention the support rods could be rigidly connected to the moveable wall members particularly if the expansion coefficient of the tubular wall surrounding the exducer portion of the turbine wheel can be matched to the expansion coefficient of the movable wall member. Such a rigid connection may also be acceptable on smaller turbines in which differential thermal expansion between components of the turbine are smaller resulting in reduced risk of jamming due to the different degrees of thermal expansion between components. Alternatively, a degree of thermal growth due to rigidly attached support rods could be accommodated by supporting the rods (within respective bushes) within slotted apertures which allow some movement of the rods in a radial direction to accommodate differential thermal expansion. Such an arrangement could be applied to any of the embodiments described above.With the embodiment of FIG. 8 the cylindrical portion 33a of the bearing housing 33 is shown as an integral part of the bearing housing 33. However, the cylindrical portion 33a may be a separate component which includes an annular flange which is clamped between the bearing housing 33 and the modified nozzle ring 110. It will similarly be appreciated that different forms of connection could be made between the nozzle ring 110 and the turbine housing 31. It will also be appreciated that whereas in FIG. 6 the moveable wall member 100 is schematically shown as having the structure of the movable wall illustrated in FIG. 5, other forms of movable wall member including for instance that shown in FIG. 4, could be included in embodiments of the invention in which a fixed nozzle ring is used to join the turbine housing to the bearing housing.As mentioned, the variable geometry turbine according to the present invention is particularly suited for inclusion in a turbocharger. However, the present invention may have other applications such as for instance power turbines. Other possible modifications of the above described embodiments of the invention, and other possible applications of the invention, would be readily apparent to the appropriately skilled person.', 'joveeye_ann': ['cummins turbo technologies'], 'pn_kind': 'A1', 'apn_num': '13000203', 'apn_original': 'US13000203', 'ipcm_value': '复式燃气轮机', 'claims_num': '27', 'title_en': 'VARIABLE GEOMETRY TURBINE', 'legal_info': 'MAINTENANCE FEE PAYMENTfree format text PAYMENT OF MAINTENANCE FEE, 4TH YEAR, LARGE ENTITY (ORIGINAL EVENT CODE: M1551)year of fee payment 4INFORMATION ON STATUS: PATENT GRANTfree format text PATENTED CASEASSIGNMENTOwner name CUMMINS TURBO TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, UNITED KINGDOMfree format text ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNORS INTEREST;ASSIGNOR:GARRETT, STEPHEN EDWARD;REEL/FRAME:025815/0156Effective Date 20091001', 'citation_num': '10'}\n",

High digitization rates and the resulting large volumes of data that must be sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return signal have limited array sizes and effectively precluded real-time operation.There is, therefore, a need in the art for improved capture and handling of data employed for coherent laser detection and ranging.SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSUREA frequency modulated (coherent) laser detection and ranging system includes a read-out integrated circuit formed with a two-dimensional array of detector elements each including a photosensitive region receiving both return light reflected from a target and light from a local oscillator, and local processing circuitry sampling the output of the photosensitive region four times during each sample period clock cycle to obtain quadrature components. A data bus coupled to one or more outputs of each of the detector elements receives the quadrature components from each of the detector elements for each sample period and serializes the received quadrature components. A processor coupled to the data bus receives the serialized quadrature components and determines an amplitude and a phase for at least one interfering frequency corresponding to interference between the return light and the local oscillator light using the quadrature components.Although specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include some, none, or all of the enumerated advantages. Additionally, other technical advantages may become readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art after review of the following figures and description.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFor a more complete understanding of the present disclosure and its advantages, reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals represent like parts:FIGS. 1A, 1B and 1C diagrammatically illustrate operation of, respectively, a pulsed LADAR system typically employed for long-range 3D imaging, an AM LADAR system typically used for shorter range applications, and an FM LADAR system based on frequency modulation of a coherent laser source;FIGS. 2 and 2A illustrate data processing associated with use of an FM LADAR system using GmAPD receivers in the detector array;FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure; andFIG. 4 illustrates use of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR for real-time interferometry in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONIt should be understood at the outset that, although exemplary embodiments are illustrated in the figures and described below, the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or not. The present disclosure should in no way be limited to the exemplary implementations and techniques illustrated in the drawings and described below. Additionally, unless otherwise specifically noted, articles depicted in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.Laser detection and ranging (LADAR) systems are the optical analog of radar systems, in which the target is illuminated with light from a laser source and the return is detected with an optical detector. The resulting signal from the optical detector is processed to determine information about the target, such as range or velocity.LADAR applications are driven to some extent by component technologies. Laser sources include both diode lasers that are generally compact, efficient, and low-cost but only low power, and eye-safe lasers that operate at wavelengths greater than about 1.5 microns (μm) and enable long-range, free-space LADAR. Detectors are often array detectors, to reduce the requirement for beam scanning. Processors, because processing of LADAR data can be computationally intensive, must typically enable high-speed—and often real-time—LADAR imaging.Two-dimensional arrays of coherent detectors are required for many advanced coherent laser detection and ranging (LADAR) systems. A conventional approach is to use an array of discrete high-bandwidth detectors each having an amplifier, analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and memory. The resulting large volume of data is then sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return signal. The high digitization rates and large volumes of resulting data have limited array sizes to a small number of pixels (on the order of 10s of pixels). There is also typically a large time interval required to process the data so that real-time operation is not achieved.LADAR systems may generally be grouped into three main categories: pulsed LADAR, in which the illuminating laser is pulsed and the detector records time-of-flight; amplitude modulated (AM) LADAR, in which the amplitude of the illuminating beam is sinusoidally modulated and the detector records phase of return amplitude modulation; and frequency modulated (FM) LADAR, in which the frequency and/or phase of the laser illumination is modulated, and the detector records the relative optical phase of the return signal. (Additionally, some LADAR systems use the parallax effect, which is not considered in this disclosure.) All three categories of LADAR systems are used in various application-dependent environments, typically with use of pulsed LADAR for long range mapping, AM modulated LADAR for short range three dimensional (3D) imaging, and FM modulated LADAR for interferometry, frequency domain optical coherence tomography, and synthetic aperture imaging.FIG. 1A diagrammatically illustrates operation of a pulsed LADAR system 100 typically employed for long-range 3D imaging. A laser source 101 emits pulsed light 102 illuminating a distant target 103. The laser 101 is ideally an eye-safe, high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) emitting pulses on the order of 1 nanosecond (ns) duration, and high pulse energy device enabling long range, large field-of-view operation by the system 100. A return part 104 of the light 102 reflecting off the target 103 and reaching an imaging telescope 105 is focused by the imaging telescope 105 onto a two dimensional (2D) detector array 106 comprising M×N pixels. The detector array 106 records return time (time-of-flight) on a per-pixel basis, with the output of the detector array 106 processed by a processor (not shown separately in FIG. 1A) capable of handling high data and throughput rates to determine relative timing of return signals at different pixels and produce a 3D image. Implementing a detector array with sufficient timing resolution is a challenging design issue for this type of system. The detector array 106 should preferably comprise detector pixels that incorporate high-speed detection and local processing, to achieve fine timing-resolution detection and reduce the volume of data sent from the detector array to the processor. Some imaging detector arrays convert optical intensity into a serialized (raster scanned) analog signal, with an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter with memory (e.g., a frame-grabber) used to capture the data before transferring the data to a processor. 2D detectors generally incorporate digital processing into each pixel and the associated detector readout circuit, which is enabled by modern, fine-detail integrated circuit fabrication processes and which forms a digital readout integrated circuit (ROIC). Applications of digital ROIC technology are especially useful for improving data quality or reducing the volume of data. Advanced infrared (IR) detectors use digital ROICs with A/D conversion incorporated into the pixels to enhance dynamic range. LADAR systems use digital ROICs for fine resolution timing of return signals, to determine the temporal location of peak return rather than digitizing the entire temporal signal.Another aspect of pulsed LADAR systems is that for long-range operation, high-sensitivity detector elements such as avalanche photo diodes (APDs) are required. In this regime, the photonic nature of the light must be considered, such that APDs are adjusted to operate in high-gain, Geiger-mode (GmAPDs). The analog signal from a GmAPD is series of temporal pulses caused by one or more of: photo-events from the return signal (shot-noise); spontaneous photo-events from dark noise (dark counts); photo-events from background light (background counts); and photo-events triggered by other events (ghosts). There can also be intra-pixel cross talk within an array of GmAPDs. Nonetheless, an array of GmAPDs with a digital ROIC is naturally well-suited for pulsed LADAR, since a GmAPD array records only time-stamps corresponding to sparse photo-events rather than digitizing temporal intensity signal and high PRF lasers allow averaging over multiple pulses to reduce impact of noise. In the photon-limited regime, the photo-sensitive detector is typically a GmAPD array with an ROIC that records arrival times for photo-events.FIG. 1B diagrammatically illustrates operation of an AM LADAR system 110 typically used for shorter range applications. The laser source 111 in this implementation provides AM modulated light 112. The relative phase of the return signal 114 focused by imaging telescope 115 on detector array 116 provides a relative 3D range over the target 113. A typical modulation frequency for the light 112 is on the order of 10s of mega-Hertz (MHz)(e.g., 30 MHz, which results in an ambiguity interval of 5 meters). AM LADAR systems are often configured as a scanning system, but more recent implementations use a detector array. For detector arrays, every pixel should be capable of independently determining the distance to the object based on light received at that pixel, in effect operating as a massively parallel laser illuminated detection and ranging (LIDAR) on a single integrated circuit. Each pixel should allow accurate measurement of the arrival time of the collected photons in order to be substantially immune to detector array surface defects that might otherwise adversely affect time of flight ranging. Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based GmAPD pixels in the detector array enable such accurate measurement. SPAD devices detect the incoming sinusoidally modulated light intensity as series of photo-events using a high speed clock cycled through four states (quadrature detection). Photo-events that occur during these separate clock states are accumulated for use in a detection process that utilizes a synchronous clock to determine a phase of the return signal based on the accumulated photo-events corresponding to the four clock states. The gaming and machine vision industries in particular have driven development of sophisticated AM LADAR detectors with photon-counting based synchronous detection, measurement of modulation quadrature values performed at the pixel level, and fabrication based on low cost complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes.FIG. 1C diagrammatically illustrates operation of an FM LADAR system 120 based on frequency modulation of a coherent laser source. The laser source in this implementation includes a master oscillator (MO) 121a, a frequency modulator (FM) 121b, and an amplifier (AMP) 121c producing the output 122 illuminating the target 123, and a second frequency modulator 121d receiving a signal from the master oscillator 121a together with a local oscillator (LO) 121e producing an output 127 illuminating the detector array 126. The target 123 is illuminated with coherent light 122 that originates from the master oscillator 121a and passes through the frequency modulator 121b and amplifier 121c. The return light 124 focused on the detector array 126 by the imaging telescope 125 interferes with light 127 from the local oscillator 121e, a frequency modulated beam derived from the master oscillator 121a. The amplitude and phase of the return signal 124 provide information about the target 123. The detector pixels detect a sinusoidally modulated interference signal—that is, the signal incident on the pixels results from coherent interference of the return beam 124 and the local oscillator beam 127. For the simple case of a frequency offset between the return and local oscillator beams, the resulting signal intensity detected by the pixels is:I\\u2061(t)=Is+ILO+2\\u2062Is\\u2062ILO\\u2062cos\\u2061(2\\u2062π\\u2062\\u2062ft+ϕ),\\nwhere I(t) is the intensity of the signal received by a pixel within the detector array, Is is the intensity of the return light 124, ILO is the intensity of the local oscillator light 127, f is the interfering frequency, and ϕ is a phase shift between the return light 124 and the local oscillator light 127 at the interfering frequency f. A feature of FM detection is that the strength of the modulated signal is proportional to √{square root over (Is)}√{square root over (ILO)}, such that the signal is boosted by the local oscillator power. In addition to being useful for long range detection, FM systems are also employed in interferometry.\\nFIGS. 2 and 2A illustrate data processing 200 associated with use of an FM LADAR system using GmAPD receivers in the detector array. An intensity signal 201, derived from interfering return and local oscillator light signals 202, corresponds to photo-events 203. Processing of the photo-event sequence 204 yields target information, including values 205 such as those illustrated in the figure. To avoid saturation of the GmAPD detector, the local oscillator level is reduced. The signal intensity detected is:I\\u2061(t)=Ns+NLO+NDCR+2\\u2062ηHET\\u2062Is\\u2062ILO\\u2062cos\\u2061(2\\u2062π\\u2062\\u2062ft+ϕ),\\nwhere Ns is the number of signal photo-events, NLO is the number of local oscillator photo-events, NDCR is the number of dark counts, and ηHET is heterodyne detection efficiency. A typical approach to implementing FM LADAR with GmAPD detector arrays has been to record a temporal sequence of photo-events and depicted in FIG. 2, then process the recorded events to compute a Fourier transform resulting in a frequency spectrum mapping of the events as illustrated in FIG. 2A to determine f and ϕ.\\nFIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The optical detector 300 is employed as the detector array 126 in the system depicted in FIG. 1C. The optical detector 300 is formed by a two-dimensional M×N array of pixels. The optical detector 300 is a large format array having more than on the order of ten pixels in each direction and preferably having on the order of hundreds of pixels or more in each direction (e.g., a 512×512 or larger array). Each pixel within the optical detector 300 has a photosensitive material 301 receiving the sinusoidal return comprising return light and coherently interfering local oscillator light as described above in connection with FIGS. 1C and 2. The photosensitive material 301 for each pixel produces an analog output 303 received by a local processing circuit 304 for the respective pixel. Each local processing circuit 304 receives a local clock signal 305 and outputs four quadrature value signals 306 representing sampling of the analog output 303 at intervals during a single sample period. The local clock signal 305 is received from, and the quadrature signals 306 are provided to, a data bus 307 that operates under the control of one or more timing/control signals 308 and that outputs serialized digital representations of the quadrature signals 306 on a signal line 309 to a processor or computer 310. Processor/computer 310 (or at least portions thereof) may be formed on the same integrated circuit chip and/or packaged within the same integrated circuit package as the remainder of optical detector 300. Within the processor/computer 310, each of the quadrature signals is separately processed in the manner described above in connection with FIGS. 2 and 2A. The detector 300 thus applies ROIC technology to coherent detection, computing quadrature components Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3 of a single interfering frequency (IF) component or optionally a small number of IF components. The quadrature components—and therefore the amplitude and phase—of the IF are computed at the sensor frame rate, allowing detection to be performed on a large format 2D detector.It should be noted that, although quadrature components are described in the exemplary embodiment above, the number of samples captured during a clock sample period may be less (e.g., three) or more (e.g., five or greater) than four. The number of parallel signal lines 306 from the local processing circuit 304 for each pixel and the data bus 307 would naturally match the number of samples captured at intervals during a single sample period.Applications of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR include real-time interferometry, velocity measurement, vibration sensing, two-wavelength 3D imaging, and wavefront sensing for atmospheric compensation. Synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR enables 3D imaging at much longer ranges than AM systems, and is applicable to the gaming industry and virtual reality systems.FIG. 4 illustrates use of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR for real-time interferometry in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. For real-time interferometry, the phase data from coherent synchronous detection is equivalent to an interferogram, and quadrature detection is equivalent to phase-shifting interferometry. In the real-time interferometry system 400, an FM laser source 401 emits illumination 402 that is split by a beam splitter 403 such that a portion is received by a frequency modulator 404, which produces frequency modulated illumination 405 based on the emitted light 402. A remainder of the emitted light 402 passes through a lens 406 onto a half-silvered mirror 407 that reflects part of the light onto a test surface 408. Portions of the light reflecting off test surface 408 passes through mirror 407 and through lens 409 to impinge upon an optical detector 410 structured as depicted in FIG. 3. The reference light 405 passes through a lens 411 and reflects off half-silvered mirror 407, and then also passes through lens 409 to impinge upon the optical detector 410. In this implementation, the light reflected off test surface 408 and passing through mirror 407 to reach the optical detector 410 corresponds to the return light 124 reflected off the target 123 in FIG. 1C, while the reference light 405 reflected off the mirror 407 to reach the optical detector 410 corresponds to the local oscillator light 127. In this application, the high frame-rate capability of the optical detector 410 allows analysis of components in dynamic conditions. The phase difference between interferograms at different times allows determination of displacement, and therefore velocity measurement (since displacement per unit time is velocity), and measurement of velocity periodicity allows determination of vibration. The difference between phase measurements at two wavelengths (which may be recorded sequentially or, for an advanced synchronous detector, on two interference frequencies) provides 3D imaging.For turbulence compensation, coherent synchronous detection also allows real-time recording of complex-values images, to which a sharpness algorithm may be used to determine atmospheric phase error to produce a turbulence-corrected image or to determine the correction to be applied to pre-compensate a high-energy laser. Additional details of turbulence correction may be found in J. C. Marron, et al., “Atmospheric turbulence correction using digital holographic detection: experimental results,” Optics Express, 17, 11638-11651 (2009).For digital holography, conventional detector arrays employ long pulse illumination with zero interference frequency. The static fringe pattern recorded represents coherent information recorded on a spatial carrier frequency. Synchronous coherent detection can operate at Q=1 rather than Q=2.Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
